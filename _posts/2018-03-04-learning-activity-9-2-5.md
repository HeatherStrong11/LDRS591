<strong>Are the major results identified and summarized?</strong>

The researchers’ results are identified, summarized and organized logically. The results for both the leader’s perspective and followers’ perspective were easy to locate.

3/3

<strong>Are the results related to the literature?</strong>

The authors compare their results to previous research and provide a personal reflection on their findings. Comparison to other literature is limited because there has not been a lot of research conducted on emotional intelligence and servant leadership at the time the article was published.

2/3

<strong>Are appropriate implications of the results for practice identified and justified?</strong>

The authors provide suggestions that logically follow from their study while admitting the limitations. They insist organizations could use the results in the selection and development of servant leaders.

3/3

<strong>Is there a thoughtful critique of the study’s limitations?</strong>

Thea authors identified and acknowledged the following limitations of their study: sample size, common bias, and the type of organization surveyed. A small number of followers were surveyed per leader, and the study only interviewed leaders in the civic field which the researchers note behave differently than those in the private sector.

3/3

<strong>Are suitable suggestions for future research provided?</strong>

Yes. The authors provide a clear direction for future research which addresses the limitations of their study. First, increase the number of followers per leader surveyed. Second, conduct a similar investigation in the private sector.

3/3

<strong>Does the review include relevant literature?</strong>

The researchers used literature in the introduction section of this review to provide evidence for the research problem to clarify what it was understood and what it needs to understand and expand upon the findings following their literature map.

The main core value of this study focused on servant leadership personality antecedents, servant leadership individual level, servant leadership group level and the influence of SL on a range of multilevel outcomes and the differential influences of SL conceptualized at the individual level and group levels which includes Turnover intentions and disengagement.

They depicted a model to address the need to integrate multiple levels of theory and analysis. Also, they apply social influence theory to better understand the influence of SL on a range of multi-level outcomes through service climate concept which includes performance, behaviors, task-focused- OCB individual level and group level.

<strong>Does the review examine sources that are recent and of high quality?</strong>

Regarding Greenleaf's (1970) essay," the servant- leader is a servant first" (Greenleaf, 1991, p.13) on servant leadership movement; there is about eight literature from the last ten years supports the study. Furthermore, they support the study with literature from 1964 to understand service climate and SL influences on multi-level to initiate a cycle service, either directly or indirectly through service climate.

<strong>Is the literature thoughtfully synthesized?</strong>

The literature is organized in the sense of theme and subtopics and briefly cite literature to document the chosen theme. The subtopics were included through a level of construct and cycle of service and depicted in a literature map.

Rated 3

<strong>Is the literature critically examined?</strong>

The literature reviewed the deficiency in the previous literature, and they expand upon to include the multi-level and multi-source data to assess leadership personality and followers outcomes in a cycle of service. It based on perceptions of raters both above and below the leader. They included the none- significant response as a limitation to results. However, the implication of the study is to adopt SL values in large companies, including manager and programs that transform leaders and managers to servant leadership model.  Also, suggested the vital role of personality testing which based on the level of care for others(agreeableness) instead of their outgoing nature (extraversion).

<strong>Does the study have a strong foundation in the literature?</strong>

The study has a strong foundation, which they included the problem and deficiencies, then the purpose of the study and the approach, methods, and results to explicitly informed literature.

They expand upon the reviewed literature to support their findings in examining the two traits that associated with cognitive-motivational process relevant to servant leadership. Therefore,  they studied leaders agreeableness and extraversion behavior and the outcomes of these traits on both followers and organizational goal.

Rate 3

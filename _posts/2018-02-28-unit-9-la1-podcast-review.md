Sadie presents what I would consider a prevalent problem among educators. The issue of burn out and stress in the workplace. Her action research is based upon her context in a school, and although she doesn&#8217;t mention how she feels personally regarding stress at work, it is clear she has observed a concerning pattern amongst her colleagues.

To address the issue of burn out and stress Sadie&#8217;s plan is to engage with colleagues initially via a qualitative research model using anonymous surveys. Although face to face interviews was considered I believe rightly Sadie choose to use questionnaires to allow colleagues to express honestly without the fear of repercussions or the pressure of answering under the pressure of an interview. One area of the research design I particularly admired was the suggested use of Google documents so colleagues could monitor the process and purpose of a meeting to engage in small group discussions. Although this isn&#8217;t necessarily data gathering at this point, it does provide an element of mixed method style to her research and accountability to the research she is conducting.

One question I didn&#8217;t necessarily see as relevant to the analysis was looking at the correlations of years taught and level of stress. As mentioned in the podcast this could be difficult to disguise and protect anonymity, but also I would be worried that a young teacher who may be experiencing burn out or stress may feel they can&#8217;t answer as honestly due to potentially wanting to hide their struggles because of embarrassment. I did, however, think it was a good idea to look at staff absences. If your study was in a large school with a significant faculty, it might be worth looking at different departments to try and discover potential problem areas.

This action research design is comprehensive and would be replicable in any educational setting. Provided the contexts allowed staff to answer honestly, the potential impact is substantial. The review process would also ensure long-term change and not just short-term solutions.

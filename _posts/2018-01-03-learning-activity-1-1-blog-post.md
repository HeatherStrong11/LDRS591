It is the human quest to seek knowledge and information and satisfy one’s sense of wonder.

A lot of what we do in our life is based on common sense, what make sense, and what we learned from others through personal experience or observations. Perpetuating truth as well as lies and myths require inquisitive minds. Practicing logical reasoning based on a given precondition or conclusion will allow to having more insight. Evaluating the outcomes and provide explanations for why and how particular results occurred.

Usually, I am more attracted to the articles that are more relevant to my field. I found it’s a good tool of building knowledge and have the learning more efficient. Reading article encouraged me to explore possibilities and helping me to understand existing issues. Apart from reading and writing, listening and speaking are also integral process in conducting information. I confess that I am not proficient in choosing articles and I am excited to learn more about it.

I am a laboratory Technologist, and in our practice in the lab, where I worked we have scientific Laboratory techniques used to produce results either qualitative or quantitative. They are based on research and experiencing the better practice. They are all formulated in what we call “standard of operation”.

In addition to relying on research and better practise, we have what we call technologist discretion. I always encourage the trainee to use the resources they have and their own discretion if they needed, and always learn when we consult with our experts about unexplainable critical conditions.

My ultimate goal is learning about leadership and scholar inquiry and uses the proper instruments.

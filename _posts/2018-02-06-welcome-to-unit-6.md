<p>I arrived safely back home this weekend after two intense weeks teaching 591 face to face in Langley!  I had a great time with the face to face group and I gave them a tour of our class website.</p>
<p>This week in Unit 6 you will be exploring a different approach to research: <em><strong>qualitative research methods</strong></em>. Plano-Clark and Creswell define qualitative research as &#8220;a set of procedures for collecting, analyzing, and reporting text and image data to answer research questions by exploring participants’ views&#8221; (2015, p. 286).</p>
<p>Qualitative research has three distinct purposes:  <em><strong>to describe, to explore, and to build theory</strong></em>.   Quantitative research and qualitative research designs differ significantly in what data are collected, how data are collected, how data are analyzed and how findings are reported.  Let me unpack this just a bit more.</p>
<p><b>What Data are Collected:</b></p>
<p><i>Quantitative research </i>seeks to collect numeric data from as large a sample as possible so to enhance claims of generalizability, using standardized data collection instruments (Leedy &amp; Ormrod, 2010, p. 96).</p>
<p><i>Qualitative research </i>gathers textual or image-based data from typically small, informative samples using loosely structured or unstructured interviews or observations (Leedy &amp; Ormrod, 2010, p. 96).</p>
<p><b>How Data is Analyzed:</b></p>
<p><i>Quantitative data </i>is analysed through statistical analyses applied to numerical data, with stress on objectivity.  Ostensibly, researcher bias and subjectivity is eliminated, or at the very least minimized (Leedy &amp; Ormrod, 2010, p. 96).</p>
<p><i>Qualitative data </i>is analysed with the goal uncovering themes and categories, with acknowledgement of potential researcher bias and subjectivity (Leedy &amp; Ormrod, 2010, p. 96).</p>
<p><strong>How Findings are Reported:</strong></p>
<p><em>Quantitative research findings</em> are reported in a formal, scientific style with full display of numbers and statistics (Leedy &amp; Ormrod, 2010, p. 96).</p>
<p><em>Qualitative research findings</em> are typically reported in a narrative form (Leedy &amp; Ormrod, 2010, p. 96).</p>
<p>As someone who was trained as a quantitative researcher, I would sometimes hear people in my discipline discredit the qualitative approach to research. However, as qualitative research has become more mainstream over the last 20 years, now I would say the most widely held opinion is that there is no best method. “It all depends on what you are studying and what you want to find out” (Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2007, p. 43). I can certainly appreciate understanding a problem or a phenomenon from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective.  For example, in order to understand the complexity and “messiness” of real-life organizations, it is important for leaders to not just rely only on statistics, but to also examine what employees. consumers, and leaders have to say from a qualitative perspective.</p>
<p>It is really important that you read through the textbook chapters on quantitative (chapters 6, 7, 8) and qualitative research (9, 10, 11) so that you can understand the distinct differences in the two approaches to research.</p>
<h3><strong>Looking Ahead!</strong></h3>
<p>In unit 8 (Feb 19-25) you will need to know how to do an audio recording for your action research idea.  Please make sure that you take some time over the next two weeks to follow the instructions in the two TWU orientation modules on audio recordings before you get to unit 8.</p>
<p>As always, let me know if you have any questions!</p>
<p>Have a great week.</p>
<p>Dr. Strong</p>

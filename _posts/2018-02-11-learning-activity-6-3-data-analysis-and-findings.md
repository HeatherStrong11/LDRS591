<h3>Data Analysis and Findings</h3>

&nbsp;

<h4>Did the researcher(s) use at least three strategies to validate the findings? (2)</h4>

Chan and So used the audit method to validate their research (2017. p.20). On first reading I felt that their Literature Review (2017. p.13-18) was a form of bracketing where the researcher reflects on their own views about the topic (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015. p. 364) but as it is not a clear setting aside of these biases, but more a clarification of what the authors define servant leadership to be, I do not think it would classify as bracketing. Chan and So also use triangulation as they interviewed the participants in three separate focus groups based on grade (2017. p. 20). So no, they only used two strategies mentioned in Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015).

<h4>Did the findings include a good description of the people, places, or events in the study? (1)</h4>

Chan and So gave details about the age, location, and culture of the participants. They did not give vivid details . The majority of their details about the students were general or broad. They did not really narrow the description of the participants or the method of study.

<h4>Did the findings include appropriate themes about the central phenomenon? (2)</h4>

Chan and So found several sub-themes with-in the main theme of servant leadership. They provided a comparison table explaining their groupings of themes to the tradition traits of servant leadership developed by spears (2017. p. 26). Chan and So used participant quotes as evidence of their themes and the quotes seem to represent the themes well (2017. p. 22-25). Though, it was hard to evaluate the quotes as accurate without being able to see the questions asked of the students. The discussion seemed valid and the quotes used match the themes well, but the discussion could have been lead to provide those type of responses.

<h4>Did the findings provide a good exploration of the central phenomenon? (3)</h4>

Chan and So delved into the topic of servant leadership and the traits that it is build upon. They explored those areas in their school setting and provided good description of the common themes there in.

<h4>Quality Rating 15/21</h4>

My overall assessment of Chan and So&#8217;s article according to the Rating Scale for Evaluating the Data Analysis and Findings in a Qualitative Research report (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015. p. 378), is that they provided Adequate quality research.

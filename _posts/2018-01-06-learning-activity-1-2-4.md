<p>I believe that the factors that shape a leader’s decision-making process are both numerous and complex. To name a few off the top of my head I would include on that list age, worldview, experience, personality, cognitive biases, socioeconomic status, sex, and health. Of course, it would be another question altogether to decide which ones play the biggest roles in a leaders decision making. If that be the case then I would lean more towards worldview and personality as being the top influences. </p>
<p>Personality and worldview go hand in hand in my opinion. The authors of the course note explain that Christians have a worldview that revolves creation, fall, and redemption. They also mention that Christians operate with a view that prompts them to serve others. While this is probably just a general statement, the following can still only be true if personality is taken into account. According to the authors Ritter and Lampink (2012), “People’s personality traits influence how easy or difficult certain tasks are for them” (p. 232). An extraverted leader may handle decision-making processes differently than an introverted though they may share the same religious values and worldview. By extension, their processes that they would use to ask questions, as well as the types of questions they would ask, might also be different.</p>
<p>Assuming that others agree with me that there are more factors at play than just worldview, it would be interesting to know someone else’s views on what they think the biggest factors are and why.</p>

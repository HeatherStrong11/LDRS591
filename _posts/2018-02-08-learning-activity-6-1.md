<p>Jones, D. (2012). DOES SERVANT LEADERSHIP LEAD TO GREATER CUSTOMER FOCUS AND EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION?. <i>Business Studies Journal</i>, <i>4</i>(2), 21-35.</p>
<p><strong>What research design was used to guide the study? Was it justified?</strong></p>
<p>The study used a grounded research design. It was justified because there was a gap in research regarding the topic and because the study had two specific goals. The study sought to provided a theory regarding the results of the study. Though the article does not specifically call its research design a grounded theory design, it does call the method &#8220;interview-driven, relying on open-ended questions&#8221; (Jones, 2012, p. 27). The article gives adequate reason as to why this method was chosen, claiming that the open-ended questions allowed participants to expound in detail on the subject of servant leadership.</p>

<p><strong>Does the qualitative research design address the study’s purpose?</strong></p>
<p>The research design does address the study&#8217;s purpose. The study incorporated probing questions and clarifying questions in order to keep participants on topic. Because the purpose of the study was to address a concept that is hard to quantify, namely, job satisfaction, the design was fitting.</p>

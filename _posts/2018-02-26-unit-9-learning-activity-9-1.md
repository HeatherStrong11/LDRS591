<p><strong>Peer-review Omolewa’s podcast</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://create.twu.ca/lewa/2018/02/22/ldrs591-unit-8-learning-activity-8-2-podcast/">https://create.twu.ca/lewa/2018/02/22/ldrs591-unit-8-learning-activity-8-2-podcast/</a></p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>1. The research focuses on a real problem in practice or the local community.</p>
<p><strong>Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>Omolewa has thoroughly illustrated two problems: helping the female group be aware of the cancer and get access to the treatment and the difficulties of raising funds. The reasons which lead to this problem have been analyzed as well, such as the religious belief and the adverse effect of the culture.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>2. The researcher is a practitioner and/or collaborates with community members.</p>
<p><strong>Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) Omolewa is a women health advocate and she has founded LEAH foundation, a non-profit organization that is devoted to the survival of the woman.</p>
<p>b) Omolewa actively collaborates with the team members in her foundation in a respectful way.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>3. The research process includes careful reflection about the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) Omolewa and her co-researchers have collected relevant information and talked with others in the organization and local community. They have analyzed the reasons leading to the current practices, such as the local female are not willing to attend the cancer diagnostic and screening programmes and hardly raising funds for this project.</p>
<p>b) Omolewa actively reflected on her own professional development and shared with her colleagues, participants, and people who have the same passion as she do.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>4. Multiple sources of good information are used.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem">Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) Omolewa explicitly mentioned that she would first explore relevant literature to see if there is any useful suggestions to solve the problem of fundings.</p>
<p>b) Then, she would gather available information and sources through all the non-profit organizations which face the same challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>5. A good action plan is advanced.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem">Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) Omolewa decided to adopt the mixed methods research design for her action plan. I hold the same opinion because the nature of her problem is quite complicated and requires considering a lot of aspects from different perspectives. Therefore, the mixed methods research design is the best choice.</p>
<p>b) She would design surveys to gather quantitative data from the community, together with organizing interviews with individuals and organizations to find out what have previously supported the non-profit communities. After the analyzation of both quantitative and qualitative data, she believes that there will be some particular findings for her situation.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>6. The study used a good action research process.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem">Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) The research process includes reflecting and thinking, looking and gathering information, and acting.</p>
<p>b) Omolewa mentioned that she and the team would monitor the outcomes of the solutions and make adjustment accordingly. Clearly, the process includes multiple spirals.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>7. The study results in meaningful actions to address the problem.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem">Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>I believe the actions took by Omolewa and her team will provide workable solutions to the problem. Also, I deem that she will conquer the leadership issue as well for detecting the strong will through the podcast. In addition, I would like to suggest Omolewa reunite the publicity in the action research to gain wider opinions and perspectives. (I am not sure whether this suggestion is appropriate for her situation. )</p>
<p><strong>Total Score = 21 (17-21 = High quality)</strong></p>
<p>Omolewa has planned a well-thought-out action research. I personally admire her courage and passion and really wish the research would work out.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<h4>Are the major results identified and summarized?</h4>

Barbuto, Gottfredson and Searle (2014) identified the results of their research based on both the leader results and the follower results as they portray to separate perspectives into the issue of emotional intelligence influencing servant leadership. While the actual concluding paragraph was brief, the paragraphs on results were both detailed and helpful to the analysis of the data. In the discussion section, Barbuto, Gottfredson and Searle (2014) summarized the data and explained the unforeseen results of their research.

<h4>Are the results related to the literature?</h4>

While Barbuto, Gottfredson and Searle (2014) do cite contemporary literature, there is very little reference to it in the back matter. They cite Greenleaf the author of the term &#8216;Servant Leadership&#8217; and apply many valid contemporary definitions to clarify their work. However, due to the fact that they are &#8220;one of the first studies to investigate antecedents of servant leadership, and the first to investigate emotional intelligence in that role&#8221; (Barbuto, Gottfredson &amp; Searle, 2014, p.322) there is not a lot of literature to which one could compare their results.

<h4>Are appropriate implications of the results for practice identified and justified?</h4>

The implication of their results is that one must look for servant leaders with high emotional intelligence to understand a servant leaders ideology, but it would not predict their behaviour as a leader, nor would it really affect followers behaviour and feelings. Trait and skill leadership is recommended along side emotional intelligence.

<h4>Is there a thoughtful critique of the study’s limitations?</h4>

Questions are raised based on the pool of participants, both leaders and followers, as to whether it was truly an effective group both in size and type to provide a more expected result. Barbuto, Gottfredson and Searle (2014) do an adequate job evaluating the limitations of their research.

<h4>Are suitable suggestions for future research provided?</h4>

Barbuto, Gottfredson and Searle (2014) suggest further research be done in the private sector to provide more diverse results and offset the poor results from the follower group. They could have challenged future researchers to provide research based on a wider variety of antecedents of servant leadership. I did recall reading (last week?) a contemporary research article that provided a good mixed methods research on a variety of antecedents of servant leadership which included duration, volunteer hours, trust relationships, and most importantly an altruistic mindset (Beck, 2014, p. 300). This might have provided Barbuto, Gottfredson and Searle (2014) more perspective on their results as the results seemed quite different.

My rating in relation to Plano-Clark and Creswell&#8217;s scale for evaluating the conclusions and back matter in a research report (2014, p477) is that this is a high quality research article that could have benefited from more examination of contemporary literature.

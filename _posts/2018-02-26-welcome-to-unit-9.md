Hi Everyone,

We are near the end of our investigation of research designs and the interpretation of research reports.  This week, in Unit 9, you will be reading about the common elements of a conclusion section of a research report in Chapter 14 of Plano-Clark and Creswell&#8217;s (2015) text.  After you have read the chapter, then you will be working through the last few servant leadership articles to evaluate and interpret the conclusions section of a research report.

I have also provided some additional slides to demonstrate the formatting details required for creating <a href="http://create.twu.ca/drheatherstrong/files/2018/02/APA-Style-References.pdf">APA Style References</a>.

<strong>Learning Activity 9.1</strong>

This learning activity asks you to peer review one Action Research project (from Unit 8) by colleagues in the class. I have posted the peer-review partnerships in Moodle under the assignments tab.

For your review, make notes about the strengths of the project idea as well as areas to work on (clarify, more analysis, more personal application) by using the evaluation criteria for an action research study outlined by Plano-Clark and Creswell on page 444-445.  There are questions listed in LA 9.1 that you will need to address in your evaluation of your colleagues action research idea.  Please see the page below for more details.

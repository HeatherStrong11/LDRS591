I would rate the article a three in every category (Plano Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 143) Sendjaya &amp; Sarros have an array of both younger and older sources. Keeping in mind that the article was written in 2002, most of the relevant sources are from the early 2000’s and late 90’s. Being that the article references Jesus and the Bible it can’t go without saying that there are a few older sources included as well! Overall, the authors wanted to give researchers one place where they could get caught up in the field of leadership. Which is also why they have older sources from the 1940’s. Ironically, the article has many sources but takes note of how little there are on the subject of servant leadership, “One reason for the scarcity of research on servant leadership is that the very notion of ‘servant as leader’ is an oxymoron” (Sendjaya &amp; Sarros, 2002, p.57). This proves that they are well versed in what research has been done in the area of leadership. In regards to the source list itself, all references are documented properly and are thoughtfully synthesized with the help of appropriate subheadings.

It is clear throughout the article that the sources are supported by the literature and are being used as a solid conceptual framework. Case in point, under the subheading ‘Greenleaf’s Model of Servant Leadership’ there is an explanation of Greenleaf’s model as it pertains to the origin of servant leadership. The section is supported by references and direct quotes from the Greenleaf source. This section also provides good evidence of qualitative research within the article as it compares and contrasts present and past trees and thoughts. Concerning quantitate research, the article doesn’t really contain a lot of studies as evidence. By extension, the article doesn’t contain any illustrations (graphs, charts, surveys, etc.).

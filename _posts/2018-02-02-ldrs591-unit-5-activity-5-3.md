Jenkins &amp; Stewart&#8217;s (2010) study will be evaluated through Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell&#8217;s (2015) seven criteria for evaluating data analysis and results in a quantitative research report on a three-point scale below:

<ol>
<li><strong>The data were rigorously scored and prepared (2/3) &#8211; </strong>Jenkins &amp; Stewart (2010) explain their scoring process and data preparation for each variable thoroughly which consists of using previously tried survey instruments and scales such as Sherman&#8217;s scale (p. 50). There is a general consistency in the distribution of the survey, but because the exact questionnaires are not provided, it is unknown whether the questions are good indicators of the variables.</li>
<li><strong>Good descriptive analyses were conducted (3/3) &#8211; </strong>The tables provided reveal good descriptive analyses and consideration of the central tendency and variability in the research; the study outlines the mean, correlation matrix, and standard deviation of each variable (Jenkins &amp; Stewart, 2010, p. 51). Z-scores are also used to &#8220;compensate for restriction of range on the basis of the Likert scale&#8221; (p. 50) used in the survey. The descriptive analyses were appropriately calculated for each variable.</li>
<li><strong>Good hypothesis testing procedures were used (2/3) &#8211;</strong> Although a null hypothesis is not stated, three alternative hypotheses of the relationship between managers&#8217; leadership and nurses&#8217; job satisfaction. The researchers also provide an Alpha level, collects data, computes the selected variables and p value, and makes a decision to confirm the original hypotheses. Due to the lack of a null hypothesis, no rejection or failure to reject the null is available.</li>
<li><strong>The results are comprehensive (3/3) &#8211; </strong>Table 1 of the study outlines the demographic characteristics of the participants&#8217; ages, ethnicity, and age (Jenkins &amp; Stewart, 2010, p. 50), and the reliability of the instruments are tested (p. 50). The results and discussion at the end of the study adequately report the outcome for each research question and hypotheses proposed at the beginning.</li>
<li><strong>The results include sufficient information (3/3) &#8211; </strong>Jenkins &amp; Stewart (2010) reports the statistic, its value, the associated p value, and significance in Table 3 and data analysis. The table is clear and consistent. The analysis explain the results clearly and its relation to the hypotheses.</li>
<li><strong>The data analysis represents a good process (3/3) &#8211; </strong>The data analysis provided a linear and objective explanation of the data collected that discuss each considered variable and the correlation or lack of correlation between them.</li>
<li><strong>The results provide a good explanation of the study&#8217;s purpose (3/3) &#8211; </strong>Readers are provided a clear understanding of the study&#8217;s purpose and the relationship between the results and original intent of the study provided in the introduction. The statistics reported are all reasonable responses to the study&#8217;s consideration of the relationship between a manager&#8217;s commitment to serve and use of role-inversion with nurse satisfaction&#8221; (Jenkins &amp; Stewart, 2010, p. 49).</li>

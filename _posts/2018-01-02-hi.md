Oops, I apologise for skipping the introduction.

My name is Simarjit Shergill. I am a physician ( Geriatrician) , living in Surrey BC, and working across the border in Bellingham, Washington. My husband is a physician too. I have 2 daughters, 19 and almost 12.

There are a lot of things I would love to do in my spare time, but to be honest I don&#8217;t have much of it! In my few leisure moments I like to read , and go for walks.

This is my first experience with online learning, it is daunting but exciting ! As I said in my earlier post, I am a clinician. I am not an expert in research, but rely on it a lot in my professional life. I hope to come out at the other end of this course a much more informed user.

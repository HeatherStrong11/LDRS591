The social anxiety disorder, which mostly happened in adolescences, was often neglected by teachers and parents for the symptoms mainly being quiet and compliant (Masia, Klein, Storch, &amp; Corda, 2001; Pandey et al., 2003). The authors wanted to raise the awareness of identifying the social anxiety disorders of the adolescences, and conducted a research to see if the school-based intervention would effectively facilitate the treatment for socially anxious teenagers. In addition, previous research suggested that the treatment offered by the community centres or public health centres was resistant by the majority of adolescences (Weist, 1999; Weisz, Donenberg, Han, &amp; Weiss, 1995), the authors wanted to find out if the school-based treatment worked better.

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Methods</strong></p>

<strong>Participants </strong>

The participants were adolescences and their parents. The adolescences’ mean age was 14.8 years. The majority of them were female (74.3%), and their ethnicity was 82.9% Caucasian, 8.6% African American, 2.9% Asian American, 2.9% Latin American, and 2.9% other.

<strong>Sampling Procedures</strong>

At the beginning, 1521 participants were recruited. The participants were adolescences in grades 9 through 11 from two parochial high schools in New York City, and their parents who indicated social anxiety associated with impairment in functioning. Then, 475 students, who scored in the top 15% through self-rated instruments or were nominated by teachers, were selected for further screening. At last, 80 students and their parents agreed to participate.

<strong>Measures and Intervention</strong>

First of all, the participants were interviewed separately by the same evaluator using the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV: Parent and Child Versions (Silverman &amp; Albano, 1996). In the meanwhile, students were diagnosed in various ways to find out if they were unqualified or not. Among those interviewed, 42 students met study criteria and rated the subject’s social anxiety at a subclinical level.

This study was conducted as a between-subjects design because the 42 adolescences were randomly assigned to different conditions including the SASS intervention and wait-list control condition. The SASS (Skills for Academic and Social Success) intervention was developed with the goal of adapting clinic-based procedures to be practical for delivery in high schools (Masia et al., 1999). This intervention included school group sessions, individual meetings, social events, peer assistants, parent meetings, teacher meetings, and booster sessions (Masia et al., 2005).

The participants were evaluated at pre-intervention and post-intervention. In addition, the wait-list control group was provided with treatment following post-assessment evaluations, while the SASS group participated in 9-month follow-up assessments. The pre-assessments, the dichotomous outcomes, and post-intervention comorbidity rates were compared between the two groups.

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Results           </strong></p>

              In terms of pre-assessment comparisons, there was no obvious difference on any demographic variable between the two groups. On the other hand, the outcome measures of the two groups at pre-intervention and post-intervention appeared distinctively. Although the data of pre-intervention of the two groups did not have much difference, the data of post-intervention of the SASS group were lower than that of the control group. The results of the comorbidity comparison showed that there was no intervention group participant were diagnosed a new comorbidity, whereas 22.2% wait-listed participants did.

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

            This study has shown that the school-based intervention could effectively get access to the treatment of adolescents with social anxiety disorder. The treated students clearly got better during the treatment and still kept a healthy status 9 months later. Not only has this study extended opportunities available for clinicians, but also the school-based intervention could be adopted as a long-term approach to diagnosing the social anxiety disorder and facilitating the treatment.

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Personal comments</strong></p>

            This study is closely related to my research question “How to effectively help the students in the elementary school (or post-secondary school) manage their anxiety disorders and academic performance at the same time”. I am very impressed by the sustainability of the school-based intervention, which is successfully proved in the study. Although the authors mainly analyze how to treat social anxiety disorders, they have successfully demonstrated that the school-based intervention is a more effective approach to help the students in the school manage their anxiety disorders. And I could resort to this intervention to find out if the other anxiety disorders can be treated equally well. In addition, this article has not mentioned any correlation between anxiety disorders and academic performance. Therefore, it still needs me to explore more and to discover other useful evidence or approach that can strongly support my research question.

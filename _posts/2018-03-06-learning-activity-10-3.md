<h3>How can I know that I can trust what I am reading?</h3>

The best way to know whether the article is valid is by researching the authors as well as the journal that the article is published in. Making sure that the journal is reputable and selective is very important because that ensures that the articles were vetted properly. Another thing I like to do is check how many times it has been cited by other articles and studies. This is an option that is available in many databases online now where it states the number of times an article has been cited by others. I use this as a general gauge of how valid the article is since I imagine that other authors who cited this article would have gone through the same investigation process to ensure the article is trustworthy.

<h3>How do I know the research has been performed competently?</h3>

Carefully reading through and analyzing the methods and procedures is an important part of deciding whether the research has been performed competently. The quality of the description of the methods section is a good measure of whether the research was executed well.

<h3>How do I know the research is reported honestly?</h3>

There is no way that I can know for sure that the research is reported honestly. However, if I have done my due diligence in researching the publishing journal and the authors and have determined that they are credible sources, then I can assume that the report is accurate. As well, comparing it with other similar research and works can help me determine whether the results presented are logical.

<h3>How do I know the findings presented are consistent with what other researchers would conclude?</h3>

I can do this by comparing the results to other similar and past research. I can also look into other articles that cited the specific research and see what other researchers have to say.

<h3>Close with one question that invites further comment and discussion.</h3>

If you are 100% certain that there are errors in a research article, what would you do? Is it professional to contact the authors?

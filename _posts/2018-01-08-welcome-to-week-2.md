<p>This week you will be exploring the topic &#8220;Accessing and Evaluating Scholarly Literature&#8221;.  This unit will help you gain familiarity with various genres of scholarly literature and help you get a sense of what scholarly sources of information are available, given your own research interests.  In this unit you will also gain first-hand experience in locating and organizing and evaluating relevant scholarly literature.</p>
<p>The learning activities in this unit will walk you through some very practical readings and video tutorials on how to access scholarly literature.  There are also three blog posts this week and those are focused on evaluating sources.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any questions, I am here to help!</p>

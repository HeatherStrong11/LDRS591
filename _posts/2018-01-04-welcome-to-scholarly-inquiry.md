Welcome to LDRS 591!

I want to welcome you to the start of LDRS 591 OL Spring 2018 and provide you with a few housekeeping details.

I am glad to see that everyone has created their own Word Press site and is connected to the main course site.

This course is organized into 10 units running from January 2-March 9, 2018. Each unit will provide you with the following:

<ol>
<li>A general overview of the topic that will be addressed during the unit.</li>
<li>Specific learning objectives for the unit.</li>
<li>Resources that you will need to read to address learning activities in the unit.</li>
<li>Specific learning activities that you will need to complete each week.  The learning activities will tell you what you need to know about assigned readings, completing blog posts, and completing assignments.</li>
</ol>

There is a timeline on the course site that outlines for you when assignments are due and what your deliverables are each week.  Please consult the timeline for an overview of what is expected each week.

<strong>Expectations for</strong> <strong>Blog posts</strong>

<span>As you work through the material in this course, you will be asked to create blog posts in the unit learning activities.  Some of the blog posts do not require a discussion or a response, however, some of the blog posts do require you to close with one question that invites further comments and discussion from your colleagues.  Please do your best to </span><span>complete the blog posts that require a response by<strong> Friday at midnight</strong> of the week they are assigned to allow time for your colleagues to respond to your questions over the weekend.</span><span><br />
</span>

<strong>Replying to Colleagues’ Posts</strong>

<p class="Paragraph">You do not have to reply to all of your colleagues blog posts when a discussion question is posted in a learning activity. However, you should make an effort to read through your colleagues posts and respond to a minimum one discussion question during unit 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 10. Your replies should offer new substantiated ideas or thoughtful questions. <span><strong> </strong>Feel free to respond to more questions if you want to.<strong>   </strong></span></p>

</div>

<p class="WPNormal">In this course you can expect that I will maintain a positive learning environment for all students.  It is important that you know that I will treat all students fairly and with respect and I will encourage discussion and participation and will offer adequate time for students to answer all questions and assignments.</p>

Please note that I will do my best to respond to emails within 24 hrs. I will return graded work in a timely fashion (usually within one week of submission) and will let you know if I need more time.

My hours of availability are: Monday-Friday between 8:45am-4:00pm (PST); Monday, Tuesday, Thursday between 7:30-9pm (PST).

If you have any questions at all please do not hesitate to contact me!  I look forward to getting to know all of you more over the next 10 weeks.

Dr. Strong

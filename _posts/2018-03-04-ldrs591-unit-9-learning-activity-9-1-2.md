<h5><strong>The research focuses on a real problem in practice or the local community </strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

Layla defined the problem as one from her professional practice; female workers are mostly unable to perform key tasks like their male colleagues. As such, they felt marginalized and insecure. She explained why the problem exists, and the consequences for females.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>The researcher is a practitioner and/or collaborates with community members </strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

Layla has been working with the organization for 9 years. She also noted that her manager also observed the problem and collaborated with her and others, towards solving it.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>The research process includes careful reflection about the problem</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

Layla described how relevant findings were obtained from past reports of staff composition and annual promotions through a collaborative team effort. This showed Layla’s collaboration with others, and her quest for professional development.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>Multiple sources of good information were used</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 2/3</strong>

Interviews were used for gathering qualitative data and information was gathered from a sample size of 30 out of 300 female employees for quantitative data. This suggests the sample size for the gathering quantitative data was small. Also, the type of research design was not specified.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>A very good action plan was advanced</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

Layla’s plans are well-articulated and involve implementing different work standards for females. It linked to the findings and reflections from the data gathered.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>The study used a good action research process</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

Layla stated: “…. we will implement this plan of action to see whether it makes a difference…” She further explained how it will be monitored for further actions based on the outcomes. This showed multiple cycles with a lot of reflection till a workable solution is found.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>The study results in meaningful actions to address the problem</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

I think Layla’s plan is very practical for addressing the problem and improving her practice. (Great one Layla!)

&nbsp;

<strong>OVERALL RATING: 20 / 21</strong> – High Quality Podcast!

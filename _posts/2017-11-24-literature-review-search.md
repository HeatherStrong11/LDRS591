The purpose of this assignment is to develop your skills to search, retrieve and review relevant literature. This assignment and Assignment 5 will be closely linked. This assignment will include the “paper trail” that provides the details of your search for relevant literature, and Assignment 5 will be the final document that summarizes the findings of your review of precedent literature in scholarly prose. Please notice that this assignment follows the search strategy suggested by Badke (2017).

In order to complete this assignment you will need to:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Identify your research topic</strong>: To begin, state the problem you are addressing in at most a few sentences and then provide your research question(s).</li>
    <li><strong>Record your search terms:</strong> In the second paragraph, identify the searchable keywords and domains of social science that arise from your problem statement.</li>
    <li><strong>Conduct a search using Library One Search:</strong> You will then conduct a search using Library One Search found at the <a href="https://www.twu.ca/library">TWU Library</a> to search everything.  Record the results of your search in a table similar to Table 1 below to organize this information (in APA format).</li>
</ul>

Table 1. <em>Library one search results</em>

[table id=9 /]

<ul>
    <li><strong>Identify key sources:</strong> Next, you will need to identify a list 10 scholarly sources that you have found to be potentially relevant to your research question and the databases that you chose to search.</li>
    <li>Please make sure you include the following information in this section:
<ul>
    <li>The two databases that I choose to search were:</li>
    <li>The search terms that I have decided on are:</li>
    <li>Describe in a paragraph how you chose the particular articles you did (that is, what inclusion and exclusion criteria you utilized).</li>
    <li>Present the results in a table similar to Table 2 below (in APA format).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Table 2. <em>Articles from academic databases</em>

[table id=10 /]

<ul>
    <li><strong>Internet Search:</strong> Next move into the literature available on the internet by conducting a search using a search engine such as <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/"><em>Google Scholar</em></a>. Briefly describe how you found the website(s)/document(s), and why or why not what you found was helpful. Please include the following in this section:
<ul>
    <li>The search terms that I used were:</li>
    <li>Present your results in table format like Table 3 below.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Table 3. <em>Internet search results</em>

[table id=11 /]

<ul>
    <li><b>Preliminary investigation summary: </b>In a fourth section, in several appropriately cited paragraphs, provide the following information:
<ul>
    <li>Present a working knowledge summary of your topic (the basic facts required to make someone familiar with the topic to a limited extent) based on what you have discovered about the topic from your initial investigations of literature.</li>
    <li>Present a brief statement outlining your personal/professional interest in this topic. In essence, you are providing a summary of the topic based on your own experiences and from the reference sources. You will want to superficially describe the relevant issues subsumed in your problem statement, including the urgency, the controversies, and anything else that will convince your reader that your problem statement is worthwhile pursuing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Create a Reference list: </strong>List all references in APA (6th edition) format.</li>
    <li><strong>Assignment formatting:</strong> APA formatting is required for this assignment. Please refer to the <a href="https://create.twu.ca/ldrs591-sp18/apa-formatting-requirements/">APA requirements</a> and APA rubric for more details.</li>
    <li><strong>Submit your assignment:</strong> Use the link at the bottom of the assignment page.</li>
</ul>

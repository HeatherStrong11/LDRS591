<p>Hunter, E.M., Neubert, M. J., Perry. S.J., Witt, L.A., Penny, L.M., &amp; Weinberger, E. (2013). Servant leaders inspire servant followers: Antecedents and outcomes for employees and the organization. <em>Leadership Quarterly, 24(2)</em>, 316-331.</p>
<p><strong>Does the review include relevant literature?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The author&#8217;s literature review is comprehensive and is relevant to the study’s topic.</p>
<p>2/3</p>
<p><strong>Does the review examine sources that are recent and of high quality?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. It should be noted they included studies that were not recent but were relevant to the study and discussion to better understand the application of servant leadership and the influence on individual and group level.</p>
<p>2/3</p>
<p><strong>Is the literature review documented properly?</strong></p>
<p>I am far from an expert in APA, but from my limited knowledge and experience, I would say yes.  The various sources were correctly and consistently referenced, and relevant to the study.</p>
<p>3/3</p>
<p><strong>Is the literature thoughtfully synthesized?</strong></p>
<p>I found it difficult to follow – to be fair it has been a long week and the inability to focus is probably on me and not the writers. It would have benefitted from some form of a visual map. However, the literature discussed does make sense in the context of the study’s topic.</p>
<p>2/3</p>
<p><strong>Is the literature critically examined?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The authors provided a clear overview of recent and old literature while identifying the current limitations in the literature which reinforced the need and the purpose of their study.</p>
<p>3/3</p>
<p><strong>Does the study have a strong foundation in the literature?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The authors were able to support the importance of their study based on the current literature. The study’s problem, purpose, and methods are connected and informed by the literature. I did not see a need for the study as I did not think it would reveal anything we did not already know regarding servant leadership.</p>
<p>2/3</p>
<p><strong>Does the literature fit the study’s overall approach?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. It is a qualitative approach, they authors justified the problem, identified the variables and provided the framework for which they would compare their findings to their initial hypothesis.</p>
<p>2/3</p>
<p>Total 15/21 – Adequate quality</p>

<strong>Direct quote less than 40 quotes</strong>

With reference to the Small, Medium and Enterprises (SMEs) in India, the study showed that “The Indian SMEs sector is very gigantic. It consists of a large number of village, tiny micro, and medium industries.” (Ambrish, 2014, p. 230).

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Direct quote more than 40 quotes</strong>

Ambrish (2014) defines entrepreneurship as follows:

Entrepreneurship refers to the act of setting up a new business or retrieving an existing business so as to take advantage from new opportunities. Thus, entrepreneurs shape the economy by creating new wealth and new jobs and by inventing new products and services. (Ambrish, 2014, p. 225).

<strong> </strong>

<strong>A paraphrased idea</strong>

One method for empowering women, is to re-design the school curriculum in such a manner that they are deliberately taught entrepreneurial skills from childhood. (Ambrish, 2014, p. 230).

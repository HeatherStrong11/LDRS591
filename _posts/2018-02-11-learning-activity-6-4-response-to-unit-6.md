<h3>Response to Unit 6</h3>
<p>As I worked through this unit my evaluation of Chan and So&#8217;s research methodology fluctuated significantly. On initial reading I felt that the small group of participants and the quotations used as evidence were detrimental to the validity of the article. Then after reading the 3 chapters of Plano-Clark and Creswell I realized that there could be validity in small participant groups. I am still skeptical of quotes used as evidence as we do not have access to the questions provided the participants. I feel that in the interest of transparency the Chan and Clark should have provided more detail into how they questioned their focus groups in order that we the reader could make a more informed decision about the evidence. I worry that the researcher could have been leading the participants to the answers that the researcher wanted and then provided quotes to demonstrate the preconceived traits of servant leadership within the participants. The most important things for me in a high quality research report are: ethically sourced data that is analyzed in the most bias free means possible.</p>
<h4>Question for Discussion:</h4>
<p>Which method of research would you likely use if you were going to turn your LDRS 591 research question into a full research study and why?</p>

This is a review of <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rob-tegelberg/action-research-for-591">Rob&#8217;s Action Research Project</a>.

<strong>Does the project focus on a real problem in practice?</strong>

<ul>
<li>Yes, the issue Rob&#8217;s project addresses is the lack of physical activities in the afternoon for students which results in short attention span and disengaged students.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Does the researcher plan to study his or her own practices or plan to collaborate with community members?</strong>

<ul>
<li>The researcher plans to use a mixed methods design in the context of his own practice where his students are interviewed and asked to complete a survey, and data is collected from other teachers.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Does the project include careful reflection about the problem?</strong>

<ul>
<li>Yes, Rob carefully reflects upon the issue and the effects it has on his students&#8217; learning.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Does the researcher plan to gather several sources of information (e.g., qualitative and quantitative procedures)?</strong>

<ul>
<li>Rob&#8217;s mixed methods design involves qualitative data where students are interviewed about their opinions of the right type and amount of daily physical activity is provided, and quantitative data that collects schedules from other teachers to evaluate the amount of physical activity and breaks and types of activities they set for their students. Rob also plans to distribute a survey to students that questions the types of activities students partake in during their recess and lunch breaks.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Does the researcher develop a clear plan for addressing the problem?</strong>

<ul>
<li>While there are great ideas on how to address the issue, I believe the reasoning of using both a survey and interviews is unclear. Choosing either the interview or survey as the process of collecting data from students is adequate. The data collection process proposed is too complicated.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Does the project include reflecting, thinking, looking, and gathering information and acting?</strong>

<ul>
<li>The overall project includes reflecting and thinking about the issue, and gathering data. Rob also proposes possible a possible action plan that involves additional scheduled activity breaks in the afternoon.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Will the results of the project enhance the lives of those involved?</strong>

<ul>
<li>The project is capable of enhancing students&#8217; and teachers&#8217; lives. Education is crucial on an individual and social levels, and providing the right environment where students are engaged and thriving enhance people individually and society as a whole.</li>
</ul>

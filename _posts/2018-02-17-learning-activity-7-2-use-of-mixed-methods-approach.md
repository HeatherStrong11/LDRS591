<h3>Use of Mixed Methods Approach in: Antecedents of servant leadership: A mixed methods study (Beck, 2014)</h3>

<h4> What was the purpose of the study?</h4>

Beck saw that there was a call in academia for mixed methods research as there was a general lack of empirical study of this method in relation to leadership (2014, p. 299). &#8220;The purpose of this article is to explore the antecedents of servant leadership using a sequential explanatory mixed methods research design&#8221; (2014, p. 299). The research question was: &#8220;Are there characteristics, behaviors, or life experiences that would predict a servant leader?&#8221; (2014, p. 304)

<h4>Is there a rationale provided for needing a mixed methods design?</h4>

The rational is that the quantitative data provides a &#8220;voice for the participants&#8221; to give more accurate and detailed explanation to the quantitative data (Beck, 2014, p. 302). When quantitative data looks at the participants and categorizes them based on age, race, gender, qualitative data gives them an individual voice to provide more detail in the results.

<h4>Is the choice of the mixed methods design appropriate and justified?</h4>

Beck chose a sequential explanatory method, starting with qualitative data and justifying the data with anecdotal evidence taken in phase II of the research (2014, p. 302-304).

<h4>What were the results of the study?</h4>

<blockquote>1. The longer a leader is in a leadership role, the more frequent the servant leader behaviors.

2. Those leaders who volunteer at least 1 hour per week demonstrate higher servant leader behaviors.

3. Servant leaders influence others through building trusting relationships.

4. Servant leaders demonstrate an altruistic mindset.

(Beck, 2014, p. 304)</p></blockquote>
The anecdotal evidence from the participants further proves that duration in leadership, volunteering, trusting relationships and altruistic mindset all influence a leaders servant leadership characteristics shown in the quantitative data.

<h4>Does the use of mixed methods produce a good understanding of the study’s purpose?</h4>

<p>Definitely. The quantitative data shows that there are tangible characteristics or behaviours that servant leaders possess and provide a reproducible scheme for attaining them, while the qualitative data further substantiates this and provides more humanity to the data, explaining that these traits develop through social interactions and can&#8217;t just be reproduced by participant intent. The study reveals that there are general traits of servant leadership that develop in the process of leading others through the process of leading others.

On another note, I really appreciated that they included an appendix with the interview questions and procedures to provide more transparency in their research. The delimitations noted (2014, p.310) seem typical of any qualitative research in that, one can never guarantee if the participants are giving honest and accurate responses.

21/21 This is an excellent example of mixed methods research.

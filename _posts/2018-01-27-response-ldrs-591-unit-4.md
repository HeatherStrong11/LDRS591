<p>My thoughts are similar to Layla&#8217;s in that prior to reading the Plan-Clark and Creswell textbook, I was vaguely familiar with the elements of what made a high quality research report. I mostly made that decision intuitively, or based on what whether I was able to find the information that I was looking for in a study. The required reading that we have done so far, in this course, has given me the tools that can help me analyse the quality of a research study better.</p>
<p>Addressing her question -&#8220;How would you organize the literature to form the theory or conceptual framework when conducting the study?&#8221; . Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) explain how a literature review can be organized into a literature map , page 137 . If one arranges the literature into different themes and places them on a map, then keeping in mind the hypothesis / hypotheses , one can formulate a conceptual framework for their study. I also think that if one uses the &#8220;thematic review &#8221; for literature (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 140), that could also give some direction towards creating a framework for a study. How the literature is organized in a research report is a very important element that helps the reader understand how the authors plan to study their hypothesis based on their review of literature.</p>

<h3>Data Analysis and Results</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Were descriptive analyses reported?</h4>
<p>Mean and Standard Deviation were used in reporting the results of the data analysis. The Data was computed through the SPSS program. The results of the questionnaire were given in a 1 to 5 Likert Scale and tested against KMO and Barlett Sphericity tests (Cerit, 2009. p. 609-610).</p>
<h4>What inferential statistics were used? (e.g., correlations, regression analysis, ANOVA, t-test)</h4>
<p>Correlations between Cerit&#8217;s questionnaire and that done by several other authors using the OLA servant leadership scale were tested to see if culture was an impacting variable, and it was found to have a 0.000 p score according to the  Barlett Sphericity test 2009. p. 608).  R squared was used to relate the data on the teacher&#8217;s perspective of servant leadership modelled in their principal to their total job satisfaction.</p>
<h4>What were the results? (What was found?)</h4>

<blockquote><p>It was found that there was significant relationship between the factors of valuing teachers, developing teachers, building community, displaying authenticity, providing leadership, sharing leadership together and the intrinsic job satisfaction of teachers (R = 0.724; R2 = 0.523; p &lt; 0.01). (Cerit, 2009. p. 610)</p></blockquote>

<p>According to the data found in Cerit&#8217;s study. 58% of the variance of teacher&#8217;s job satisfaction can be related back to servant leadership (2009. p. 613)</p>
<h4>Did the analysis represent a good quantitative process?</h4>
<p>Yes, the results are coherent with the overall research design. The results take into account outliers and demonstrate probabilities of accuracy to 0.01. In general this appears to be a well thought out and researched article.</p>
<p>20/21 on the Rating scale for evaluating the data analysis and results in a quantitative research report.</p>

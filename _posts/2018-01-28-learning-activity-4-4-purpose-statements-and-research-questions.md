<h3>Purpose Statements and Research Questions</h3>
<h4>Is the study’s purpose clearly specified? (3)</h4>
<p>The following is the purpose statement as stated by Parris and Peachey:</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<blockquote><p>Thus, the purpose of this study was to systematically examine and organize the current body of research literature that either quantitatively or qualitatively explored servant leadership theory in a given organizational setting. (2013. p.378)</p></blockquote>
<p>The purpose is concise and clear. In the following paragraph Parris and Peachey give clear explanation into the framework focus and intent of their research.</p>

</div>
<h4>Is the focus of the study appropriate? (3)</h4>
<p>According to Plano-Clark and &amp; Creswell the focus of a qualitative research study should be a broad focus about a central phenomenon (2015. p. 165). Parris and Peachey are focused on the issue of servant leadership and view it from a qualitative perspective in their research.</p>
<h4>Is the overall intent of the study appropriate? (3)</h4>
<p>The article is a study of various articles on servant leadership to provide a clear understanding of the major focuses in servant leadership. Parris and Peachey explore this phenomena in a precise manner and list the indications of the phenomena in the second half of their article.</p>
<h4>Are the participants and the sites appropriate? (3)</h4>
<p>Yes. The participants and sites are fellow academics. Their opinions and research on the phenomenon of servant leadership are found in a variety of peer reviewed journals, handbooks/texts, etc.</p>
<h4>Is the purpose of the study narrowed through appropriate research questions and/or hypotheses? (3)</h4>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<blockquote><p>The following research questions guided this SLR: (a) How was servant leadership defined? (b) In what contexts was servant leadership theory empirically investigated? (c) How was servant leadership examined (i.e., the meth- odology)? and (d) What were the results of the examination? (Parris &amp; Peachey, 2013. p. 378)</p></blockquote>
<p>None of their research questions began with preconceived notions.</p>

<h4>Does the purpose of the study follow logically from the statement of the problem and the literature review? (3)</h4>
<p>Yes, Parris and Peachey begin with a background in the topic of servant leadership, and give a clear history of where the topic originated. They then go on to study current theories of servant leadership before delving into the methodology of their research.</p>
<h4>Is the purpose consistent with the study’s overall approach? (3)</h4>
<p>All of Parris and PEachey&#8217;s research questions are open ended, and allow for a variety of answers. After viewing the research they interpret the data to showcase the most prominent ideas on the subject of servant leadership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Rating</h5>
<p>According to Plano-Clark and Creswell&#8217;s rating scale for evaluating a purpose in a research project (2015. p. 186), Parris and Peachey have a high quality research report. 21/21</p>

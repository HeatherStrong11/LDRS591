Transformational leadership is characterized by idealized (or charismatic) influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration while servant leadership is marked by it&#8217;s ten characteristics &#8211; listening, empathy, healing, awareness, persuasion, conceptualization, foresight, stewardship, commitment to growth of people, and community building (TWU, 2017, p. 14). A transformational servant leader always puts the best interest of the followers first. In order to do so effectively, a transformational servant leader must be knowledgeable and well-informed in all the decisions that he or she makes. To do this, a servant leader must used evidence-based decision making.

While a leader must make decisions based on sympathy and the feelings of those around him or her, it is also important to sometimes remove emotions from the situation and to make a decision based on evidence. Evidence-based research offers insight on long-term effects of decisions made by others and thus can offer valuable knowledge that leaders should consider in their decision-making. In a sense, evidence-based decision making allows leaders to avoid mistakes or errors already made by others in the past. It eliminates unnecessary trial-and-error in leadership.

Using evidence-based decision making also gives credibility to a leader&#8217;s strategies and leadership. When followers know that the leader has done his or her due diligence and research all the implications of a decision, they will be more likely to put their trust in the leadership.

An effective leader is a life-long learner. As society and culture changes, so do effective leadership strategies and methods. By continually looking to evidence-based research and studies to improve leadership skills, a transformational servant leader can remain relevant and aware of the needs of the followers.

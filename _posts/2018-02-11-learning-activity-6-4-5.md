As a consumer of research reports, the most important things for me in the methods and results sections of a high-quality qualitative research report are:

&#8211;          Appropriate research design that addresses the purpose of the study

&#8211;          Appropriate method for collecting data

o   Data collection is ethical and thoughtful

&#8211;          The researchers establish the trustworthiness and dependability of their study by:

o   Using at least three acceptable strategies to validate their findings

o   Researchers identify any possible biases

Short but sweet. I feel if a qualitative research study meets the above criteria it is likely to be reliable and could be a valuable resource if it is relevant to your research. I should note, I prefer quantitative studies over qualitative as I find qualitative to be subjective.

Discussion question:

Is there a way to combine quantitative and qualitative research studies that would add value to one&#8217;s research?

<h1>Using Quotations</h1>

<h4>A direct quote less than 40 words with proper in-text citation (6.03)</h4>

Before the quote would be my text and information related to the following quote, there might be a transition sentence setting up the quote as evidence to prove my point but it could just be clarification of what I think from another persons perspective. &#8220;According to these findings, it was determined that the most effective variable in predicting computational thinking in the valid model was ways of thinking&#8221; (Durak &amp; Saritepeci, 2018, p. 200). Then I would continue writing after the quote.

<h4>A direct quote more than 40 words with proper in-text citation (6.03).</h4>

Before the quote I would write my paragraphs and set up a transition sentence prefacing the quote and preparing the reader from an outside author&#8217;s perspective the thoughts I am covering.

<p style="padding-left: 30px">According to model analysis findings, it was established that ways of thinking directly affected computational thinking. It was found that computational thinking was highly predicted by variables of ways of thinking, maths class academic success, attitude against maths class, level of education, science class academic success, information technologies academic success, attitude against information technologies class, sex, IT usage experience, period of daily internet use and attitude against science class. According to these findings, it was determined that the most effective variable in predicting computational thinking in the valid model was ways of thinking. (Durak &amp; Saritepeci, 2018, p. 200).</p>

After the quote I might further develop the idea while using the block as a foundation for my idea. I would continue with my article etc.

<h4>A sentence that refers to an idea from the article (paraphrased), and provide a proper in-text citation (6.11-6.12)</h4>

The notion that ways of thinking influences students success in areas of computational thinking skills is essential when planning curriculum (Durak &amp; Saritepeci, 2018, p. 200). Or, I could use the same idea that Durak &amp; Saritepeci (2018) stated about the use of statistics to analyze our results this shows I have paraphrased their idea and acknowledged it was theirs. If we fail to take this idea into our planning we will fail to create a curriculum that is adaptable to all students. We must focus on developing these ways of thinking skills for all students so that they have an equal opportunity for success.

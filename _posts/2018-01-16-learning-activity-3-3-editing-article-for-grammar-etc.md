<h3>Editing Article for Grammar</h3>
<p>NOTE: The area I am currently concerned about is Italics (4.21). I am wondering if when I list &#8220;Personal Information Form Questionnaire, a Computational Thinking Skills Scale, and a Thinking Ways Scale&#8221; I should put them in italics as they are the title of a survey or new idea. I know I should use italics sparingly so I figure it is probably best to leave the italics out.</p>
<p>I am also concerned about Parallel construction (3.23) and wonder if the following line needs to be rewritten in relation to the rest of the article as Math and Science Class success are two of the hypothesis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Computational thinking skills are most influenced by Math and Science class success, education level, and ways of thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Should it be &#8220;Computational thinking skills are most influenced by Math, Science class success, and education level, and ways of thinking&#8221;</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>&#8220;Computational thinking skills are most influenced by Math class success, Science class success, education level, and ways of thinking&#8221;</p>
<p>or something else?</p>
<p>As in the last assignment, when I imported my work to wordpress it changed all my formatting, so I have attached a pdf.</p>

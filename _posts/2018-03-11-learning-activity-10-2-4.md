But in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect.  1 Peter 3:15 (ESV)

The Bible is clear, as Christians we must not only have reasons that support our beliefs but also be prepared to defend our faith. In other words, our faith is based on evidence and fact, not on subjective feelings. Likewise, as a someone that strives to be a transformational servant leader, my decisions must be rooted in evidence.

If your beliefs and decision are based on evidence, it will increase your credibility not only as a leader but also as a person. As a result, it will increase the trust others place in you, which will improve your influence and ability to lead effectively.

Why re-invent the wheel? Many leaders had come before us and solved many similar problems we are currently facing. If there is a proven solution supported by evidence, you would be foolish not take it into account. I find far too often people waste their time trying to find a solution to a problem that has already been solved.

There was something else, but it slipped my mind so I will continue with some unfiltered thoughts of evidence-based decision making. We assume our doctors are making decisions rooted in evidence. If we care about our followers and developing those around us, then we ought to base our decisions on evidence as well. Finally, don’t try to be a hero. As I mentioned before there are already a ton of solutions available to many of our problems, if our decisions are founded on evidence then it is more likely you’ll find your choices are aligned with best practices.

Everyday everyone makes decisions imagine what the world would look like if everyone made those decisions based on evidence instead of emotion. What a world it would be.

The question&#8230;.if the punishments for deliberately authoring or publishing misleading research are effective and serve as deterrents ?

&nbsp;

As consumers of research the onus lies on us to determine whether the research we are counting on has been conducted ethically and honestly . There is a certain amount of trust that we have to have going in. Having said that who is holding the researchers accountable to the honesty of their research? I believe in part it is the responsibility of the journal or other resource that the study is being published in. One would hope that the peer-review process would also include a scrutiny of the elements that Lewa mentions in her post- namely technical errors, inconsistencies in research question and findings, conflicts of interest. Reading her comment made me think too whether there are punishments for publishing erroneous or misleading research. I anecdotally know that a doubtful publication can affect an authors&#8217; credibility amongst their peers. I am not sure if there are any punishments meted out in legal terms or loss of licensure etc. I&#8217;m sure our prof can throw some light in this .

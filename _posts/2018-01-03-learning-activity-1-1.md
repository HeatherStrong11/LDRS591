I have had experience with research both academically and personally. While completing my undergraduate degree in Science, I often had to do research for mathematical analysisÂ  papers and scientific lab reports. As a mathematics major, I am naturally drawn to research papers that focus on quantitative studies. However, I regularly read qualitative research papers to further my knowledge in existing mathematical theories and current scientific research.

Recently, I gave birth to my baby daughter, Macey. Becoming a mother has given me the opportunity to be a servant leader to my baby. After she was born, we encountered a lot of trouble having Macey latch and breastfeed. Macey lost a lot of weight in the first few days, which resulted in several hospital visits. I quickly realized I had to make an important decision about Macey&#8217;s feeding. My options were to continue to nurse, to switch to pumping and bottling, or to switch to formula feeding. I used several types of information to make my decision. While research showed that nursing is the most natural and nutritious way for a baby to feed, I knew from personal experience that this was detrimental to Macey&#8217;s health because she simply could not latch properly or long enough to get the nutrients she needed. The next most common feeding method was switching to formula. However, at the hospital, all the nurses and doctors recommended that I stayed away from formula feeding as there are nutrients in breast milk that formula lacks. To be honest, I was brought up on formula so I am not adverse to formula feeding. After seeing a lactation consultant, I was presented with a third option that I had not considered before, pumping and bottling. I did some research into this feeding method to see if the nutrients would be preserved and whether this is a viable long-term option. Research studies show that bottled breast milk carries just as much nutrients and antibodies. I also joined an online group for mothers who exclusively pump to read about their anecdotal experiences with the process. After meeting with several more specialists and getting their opinions, I decided that exclusively pumping for Macey was the best way to keep her healthy and maintain my sanity. Currently, this is still the feeding method we are using. I routinely try to see if she can learn to nurse effectively because as things change and as she grows, I am aware that my decision to pump exclusively could change as well. Having done ample research and sought out as much advice as possible from doctors and other moms, I am able to feel assured and confident in my decision.

<strong>How did the authors of the articles conceptualize evidence-based leadership?</strong>

Walshe &amp; Rundall (2001, p.435) state &#8220;It seems that there is still a gap between the idealized, ambitious aims of evidence-based health care and the realities of practice for most patients and practitioners.&#8221; Although a healthcare-specific example it appears to be a common theme identified in all the articles read. That although evidence-based research is increasing its availability in various sectors, the measurability of its impact is still somewhat unknown. I found it interesting to learn of the contrast in approach to research taken by doctors and or consultants compared to healthcare management. Although both identified as leaders within society, their relationships with evidence-based research differ tremendously. All three articles I believe demonstrate the case for ensuring that evidence-based research is considered in significantly more leadership and or management decisions across all public and private sectors.

<strong>What is considered as “evidence”?</strong>

The NCLB (2002, as cited in Trybus, 2007) defines scientifically based research as &#8220;research that involves the application of rigorous, systematic, and objective procedures to obtain reliable and valid knowledge relevant to education activities and programs.&#8221; In its simplest form evidence is trying to sort fact from fiction. Trybus (2007) argues that only true science-based experiments can provide evidence of whether something works or not. Although, this could be true as Patton (2001) rightly considers the problem with evaluating evidence is quite often the degree of rigor used.

<strong>In your own words, why is evidence-based decision-making important?</strong>

I believe evidence-based decision making is essential in ensuring that actions are taken based upon more in-depth consideration and evaluation rather than word of mouth or hearsay. In my sector in education even in my relatively short career so far I have seen significant money and resources wasted based on personal preferences, pedagogy, or even philosophy. I also believe using this process helps give credibility when having to justify any mistakes or change of direction you may need to take in leadership. If you made the best decision, you could at the time using research and evidence this can only be a positive.

<strong>Question</strong>

What barriers do you feel exist that stop working professionals accessing and considering research in the decision making process?

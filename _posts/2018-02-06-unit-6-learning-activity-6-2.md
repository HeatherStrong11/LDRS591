The Influence of Servant Leadership on Restaurant Employee Engagement

<strong>Quality Criteria</strong>

1.The sampling strategy is appropriate and justified.

<strong>Rate</strong>

3=Excellent

<strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong>

a) The researchers explain clearly in the method section about the reason of intentionally choosing Celebration Restaurant as the site.

b) Although the researchers do not explicitly offer the name of the purposeful sampling strategy, it is easy to conclude that the maximal variation sampling strategy is adopted in this study. Because the participants are selected based on several criteria (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014).

c) The procedures are fully described and match the maximal variation sampling strategy.

d) The researchers provide strong reasons for selecting the maximal variation sampling strategy in the beginning of the method section.

<strong>Quality Criteria</strong>

2.The sample size is appropriate and justified.

<strong>Rate</strong>

3=Excellent

<strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong>

a) There are 11 individuals participating the study, which means the sample size is sufficiently small so the researchers can capture rich detail.

b) The sample size is consistent with the case study research design.

c) A sound rationale is provided in the participants subsection to justify the sample size is appropriate.

<strong>Quality Criteria</strong>

3.The data types are appropriate.

<strong>Rate</strong>

3=Excellent

<strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong>

The researchers collect different types of data including focus group data, documented data, direct and non-obtrusive observations, and focus group interviews with open-ended semi-structured questions. These types are appropriate for the case study research design.

<strong>Quality Criteria</strong>

4.The data are gathered using rigorous qualitative procedures.

<strong>Rate</strong>

3=Excellent

<strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong>

a) The researchers gather information using open-ended forms to learn about participants&#8217; perspectives and experiences.

b) The data are tape recorded for professional transcription, and the researchers take notes as able.

<strong>Quality Criteria</strong>

5.Data collection issues are handled ethically and thoughtfully.

<strong>Rate</strong>

3=Excellent

<strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong>

a) The participants have read the consent and confidentiality statements and they have the opportunity to withdraw their participation as well as reserve the right to withdraw their participation once the focus groups are completed.

b) The training room is selected for the convenience of the participants and to maintain a level of comfort for them.

c) The participants are compensated for their time.

<strong>Quality Criteria</strong>

6.The selected participants are information rich.

<strong style="font-size: 1rem">Rate</strong>

3=Excellent

<strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong>

a) The sites and participants clearly fit the study purpose.

b) Two focus groups have achieved data saturation.

<strong>Quality Criteria</strong>

7.The database provides extensive and credible information about the central phenomenon.

<strong style="font-size: 1rem">Rate</strong>

2=Good

<strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong>

The study does not explicitly present the extensive database, but the multiple types of open-ended data collected in two-month period are clearly related to the study&#8217;s intent.

<strong>Total Score = 20 (17-21 = High quality)</strong>

“Graphic Organizers” are not a tool I would typically employ as my mind does not work that way. They usually create a great deal of frustration. Many that know me would be surprised that there is a perfectionist deep within me, which swiftly reared its ugly bearded face as I began this assignment, hence the symmetrical nature of my concept map. Without further to do, here are seven – after all seven is the Biblical number of perfection – potential research questions I identified:

<ol>
<li>How can I incorporate the Christian worldview coupled with classical education into a public setting to ensure the development of the whole child (mind, body, and soul)?</li>
<li>How can teachers and leaders stress academic rigour while also providing a culture of healing for students with severe trauma?</li>
<li>How can outdoor adventure, sports, and nutrition contribute to the healing process of trauma victims? How relevant are lessons learned through sports to academic success?</li>
<li>How does overall health and wellness affect professional and personal life?</li>
<li>How to effectively schedule a time to allow staff to build relationships with each other and students without the pressure of academics? What effect do relationships have on academic success and healing?</li>
<li>Should Biblical principles influence how we care for all of God’s creation? How would farming change? Nutrition? Our daily lives?</li>
<li>Can teaching skills of self-reliance empower and bring about healing in the life of trauma victims?</li>
</ol>

To satisfy my current professional need but also my long-term personal interest and goals I believe some combination of 3, 6, and 7 offer the greatest research potential. Such as:

<strong>How can outdoor adventure, sport, and proper nutrition impart skills of self-reliance to empower and heal those of trauma to bring about academic achievement?</strong>

I desperately want to focus on stewardship and sustainable farming, and I am confident that it would be a valuable tool in healing, but I feel right now it is not relevant to my current situation and it will have to wait. I have chosen this research question for the following reasons:

<ul>
<li>Majority of students at my school have suffered some form of trauma (sexual abuse, neglect, personal abuse, observing abuse between parents, etc.)</li>
<li>Many students suffer from low self-esteem and mental health issues</li>
<li>All students are performing below grade level</li>
<li>Lack of social and emotional skills among students</li>
<li>Current system is failing them, some form of alternative schooling is needed</li>
</ul>

As one can see, research in the area of trauma and healing will provide the greatest positive impact on my school and the local community. It is for that reason alone I have chosen it over other areas of great personal interest.

To effectively complete research I will turn to the field of education, healthcare, and psychology in the form of scholarly articles and books relevant to my topic.

The four interests I chose for this concept map are social justice, literature, leadership, and family.  My concept map produced five research questions from the combination of these personal and professional interests. The three questions that seem most interesting are:

<ol>
<li>Housing stability positively effects addictions recovery, but how can leaders further support our guests&#8217; transition into housing to encourage change?</li>
<li>Are the systems between hospitals, organizations, and the city effective in connecting our clients to the right resources?</li>
<li>What systems could be implemented to encourage innovation from the team to initiate change?</li>
</ol>

To further narrow down these questions, I felt the strongest one of the three is: Are the systems between hospitals, organizations, and the city effective in connecting our clients to the right resources? Working in the downtown east side community of Vancouver, organizations such as hospitals, non-profits, and the Ministry share clients. We all aim to help our clients make progress in areas such housing, their addictions, and health, but there is often a communication gap and a lack of understanding about one another&#8217;s available services and resources. This creates frustrations as organizations send clients to services that do not fit their needs, and each organization faces the same need of understanding the individual&#8217;s situation from the beginning. With a better communication system, a shared network of knowledge about a client or of resources could be achieved and further our client&#8217;s progress greatly. Also, as my third question indicates, I am in pursuit of finding productive and engaging ways of encouraging innovation and ideas from a team, and I believe the question chosen prepares a venue to explore this second idea of innovation. Surveying my team&#8217;s and other organization&#8217;s ideas on how to achieve better communication between organizations would certainly help me delve into different systems that effectively collect these ideas. Beyond surveying people in the social work sector, I plan to explore literature in the healthcare, leadership, religion, and business fields to inform my question.

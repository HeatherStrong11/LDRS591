<p><strong>What quantitative research design is used and is it justified?</strong></p>
<p>In this study the survey research design was used in order to determine the link between servant leadership in nursing and job satisfaction. The study used 251 nurses from a variety of departments. This is an adequate number that can be used to represent a large group. The participants were given four questionnaires in total. Given the purpose of the study, this research design was appropriate.</p>
<p>Rating: 3</p>
<p><strong>Are good quantitative procedures used to select and assign participants?</strong></p>
<p>Nurses from 17 different departments were selected based on their responsibility to provide direct bedside patient care. All of these nurses were part of a large health care system. Participants were told why the study was being done and were ensured confidentiality. The study was not mandatory for their work.</p>

<p><strong>Are good quantitative data collection procedures used?</strong></p>
<p>The participants were given four questionnaires in total and data was collected regularly at staff meetings. Again, confidentiality was ensured regarding data collection.</p>
<p>Rating: 3</p>
<p><strong>Does the quantitative research design address the study&#8217;s purpose?</strong></p>
<p>Given the fact that this survey research study was voluntary and included nurses from a variety of departments with different department heads, this research design addressed the study&#8217;s purpose well. It is particularly important that one questionnaire on the topic of job satisfaction was given, as this was a crucial point of interest for the study. The data is analyzed and discussed in the article with implications and conclusions thoroughly explained.</p>

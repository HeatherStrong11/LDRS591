<strong>Is the study’s purpose clearly specified?</strong>

The purpose of the study stated in the abstract&#8221; Our purpose was to test the relationship between personality servant leadership and critical followers and organizational outcomes&#8221;(Hunter et al.2015) However, they refer to it in the introduction section as&#8221; a need to better understand better the influence of servant leadership&#8230;.&#8221;. Also, on the other hand, more advanced research design and comprehensive exploration&#8230;..&#8221; to explain their intent of this study, framework, and model, participants, and setting.  The signal for the purpose with the intent of the study included.

Rated 3

<strong>Is the focus of the study appropriate?</strong>

The two major predictor/measured variables identified are leader agreeableness and leader extraversion and also included personality/individual level of SL and store-level SL. They included the dependent variables such as followers perceptions of the SL, followers turnover intentions, disengagement, followers helping/sales behavior, task-focused OCB-I, and store performance. Besides, control variables included service climate as a mediator in all levels of relationship between leadership and followers variables. No confounding variable detected, however; in the limitation, un-controlled recruitment process by managers found which introduces sampling bias.

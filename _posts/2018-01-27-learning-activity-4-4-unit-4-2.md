<p><strong>Is the study’s purpose clearly specified?</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the study stated in the abstract&#8221; Our purpose was to test the relationship between personality servant leadership and critical followers and organizational outcomes&#8221;(Hunter et al.2015) However, they refer to it in the introduction section as&#8221; a need to better understand better the influence of servant leadership&#8230;.&#8221;. Also, on the other hand, more advanced research design and comprehensive exploration&#8230;..&#8221; to explain their intent of this study, framework, and model, participants, and setting.  The signal for the purpose with the intent of the study included.</p>
<p>Rated 3</p>
<p><strong>Is the focus of the study appropriate?</strong></p>
<p>The two major predictor/measured variables identified are leader agreeableness and leader extraversion and also included personality/individual level of SL and store-level SL. They included the dependent variables such as followers perceptions of the SL, followers turnover intentions, disengagement, followers helping/sales behavior, task-focused OCB-I, and store performance. Besides, control variables included service climate as a mediator in all levels of relationship between leadership and followers variables. No confounding variable detected, however; in the limitation, un-controlled recruitment process by managers found which introduces sampling bias.</p>
<p>Rated 3</p>
<p><strong>Is the overall intent of the study appropriate?</strong></p>
<p>The overall intent of the study explained, described, and predicted the major variables.</p>
<p>They also tested the relationship the SL model on multi-level of theory and analysis in respect to followers and service climate. They included ten hypotheses to vision the relationship and its results.</p>
<p>Rated 3</p>
<p><strong>Are the participants and the sites appropriate?</strong></p>
<p>They used multilevel and multi-source model, surveyed 224 stores of a retail organization including 425 followers, 110 store managers, and 40 regional managers. The general people and setting fit the focus and intent.</p>
<p>Rated 3</p>
<p><strong>Is the purpose of the study narrowed through appropriate research questions and/or hypotheses?</strong></p>
<p>They presented ten hypotheses follow from the purpose by examining the specific relationship among variables and making predictions about the relationship as 1)leadership agreeableness is positive to followers perceptions of servant leadership. 2)leader extraversion is negatively related to followers perceptions of servant leadership. 3)Individual-level servant leadership is negatively related to follower turnover intentions. 4)Individual-level servant leadership is negatively related to follower disengagement. 5)store-level servant leadership is positively related to follower helping behavior. 6)Service climate mediates the relationship between store-level servant leadership and followers turnover intentions. 7)service climate mediates the relationship between store-level servant leadership and followers disengagement. 8)Service climate mediates the relationship between store-level servant leadership and follower helping behavior. 9)Service climate mediates the relationship between store-level servant leadership and followers sales behavior. 10)Service climate mediates the relationship between store-level servant leadership and followers sale behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Does the purpose of the study follow logically from the statement of the problem and the literature review?</strong></p>
<p>The reasons for the study&#8217;s major variables, intent, theory, participants, and sites well argued. The purpose research questions are formulated from existing knowledge to fill their research inquiry and produce results may have significance for the audience.</p>
<p>Rate 3</p>
<p><strong>Is the purpose consistent with the study’s overall approach?</strong></p>
<p>The purpose an, research questions, and hypotheses are narrow and specific. They based on the literature and applicable theory to fill their research inquiry, they remain fixed during the study. They describe trends in variables, and relationship between the groups. The study fits quantitative research approach.</p>

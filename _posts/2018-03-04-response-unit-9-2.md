<p>In Response to Ruth</p>
<p><strong>Stating the limitations of a study can help readers determine the validity of the study and to understand some of the biases in the study. However, since the weaknesses are being pointed out, does stating the limitation strengthen or weaken the results of the study?Â </strong></p>
<p>Limitations are outlined at the conclusion of the discussion section as an acknowledgment of the need for further study. The limitation should be reiterated, so it could direct the researchers about how applying a different methodology might address the research problem more effectively in a future study. An underlying goal of the scholarly research is not only to show what works but to demonstrate what doesn&#8217;t work or what needs further clarification. The study limitations focused on shortcomings in the extent of the reasons that researchers chose to use specific research approach at the beginning of their research study.</p>

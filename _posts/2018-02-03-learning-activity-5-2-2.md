<p>The article I chose to focus on for this unit is<em> The Effects of Servant Leadership Behaviours of School Principals on Teachers’ Job Satisfaction</em> by Yusuf Cerit.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>What sampling strategy was used and was it justified?</em><br />
<strong>Rating: 1/3<br />
</strong>The participants were 700 public primary school teachers from the province of Duzce in Turkey (Cerit, 2009, p. 608). While Cerit (2009) does detail the gender and professional and academic background of the teachers, he fails to describe the rationale and procedure of the sample selection (p. 608).</li>
<li><em>Is the sample size appropriate and justified?</em><br />
<strong>Rating: 2/3<br />
</strong>The sample size of 700 is fairly large (Cerit, 2009, p. 608). Cerit (2009) does describe a method of measuring variances in his collected data in the procedures (p. 610) but he does not make attempts to explain or justify the sample size.</li>
<li><em>Are good quality measures used to gather data? How do you know they are good quality?</em><br />
<strong>Rating: 1/3<br />
</strong>Cerit (2009) collected the data using questionnaires with 68 items (p. 608). For qualitative characteristics such as this, this is the only way to quantify the results. However, Cerit (2009) does not give further information on how the data was collected or what kind of instructions were given to the participants. We are left to assume that proper and consistent instructions were given to all the participants. Cerit (2009) only lists examples of the items that were included in the questionnaire (p. 608). He (2009) details the breakdown of the type of questions asked but not the specific questions (p. 608-609).</li>
<li><em>Are the data gathered using ethical procedures?</em><br />
<strong>Rating: 1/3<br />
</strong>Cerit (2009) does describe in detail the process of collecting the data so we are left to assume that ethical procedures were used. Since the participants were all adult professionals, we can assume that all of them are capable to ensuring that they were treated ethically and professionally.</li>

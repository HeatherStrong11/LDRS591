Using Plano-Clark and Creswell&#8217;s (2015) evaluation criteria of a research problem, I will evaluate Parris and Peachey&#8217;s (2013) question: How was servant leadership (SL) defined, empirically investigated, and examined in precedent literature (p. 378)? The evaluation criteria consists of seven components which are rated on a scale of 0-3 from poor-excellent as indicated below:

<ol>
<li><strong>The topic is interesting</strong> (2/3) &#8211; While the question is intriguing, the study&#8217;s research goal does not seek to answer the specific question of how to empirically investigate SL, but instead compiles and organizes previous ideas from previous literature. I am more interested in the specific answers to the question than a discussion on how others studied SL in the past.</li>
<li><strong>There is a meaningful problem</strong> (3/3)- The problem proposed by Parris &amp; Peachey (2013) is &#8220;Greenleaf&#8217;s conceptualization of servant leadership as a way of life rather than as a management technique perhaps has slowed the acceptance of this leadership theory in academia&#8221; (p. 378). Servant leadership is a viable leadership theory capable of resolving leadership issues in the twenty-first century (p. 378), but due to the current presentation of SL as a philosophy, it is not taken as a leadership technique; this is a meaningful issue.</li>
<li><strong>The importance of the problem is justified</strong> (3/3)- Precedent literature recognize the &#8220;positive effects of servant leadership on organizational profits and employee satisfaction&#8221; (Parris &amp; Peachey, 2013, p. 378), but without a testable and observable evaluation process, SL &#8220;would be difficult to operationalize and apply&#8221; (p. 378). The importance of recognizing SL as a practical leadership technique is justified.</li>
<li><strong>There are deficiencies in the knowledge about the problem</strong> (3/3) &#8211; The article states &#8220;there does not exist a comprehensive summary of empirical studies exploring servant leadership theory in organizational settings [&#8230;], which is a gap in the extant literature&#8221; (Parris &amp; Peachey, 2013, p. 378) and that &#8220;only a limited amount of research has empirically examined [SL]&#8221; (p. 378). This indicates the lack of empirical knowledge compiled in this area.</li>
<li><strong>There are audiences who can benefit from the missing knowledge</strong> (2/3)- Parris &amp; Peachey (2013) identify beneficiaries of this study as &#8220;scholars and practitioners who are responding to the growing perceptions that corporate leader have become selfish and who are seeking a viable leadership theory to help resolve the challenges of the twenty-first century&#8221; (p. 378). My issue  is the study may not have a significant compilation of studies to fill this missing knowledge by compiling information alone.</li>
<li><strong>The passage clearly argues that the study is warranted</strong> (3/3) &#8211; Parris &amp; Peachey (2013) argue its method &#8211; systematic literature review &#8211; &#8220;adopts a replicable, scientific, and transparent process that aims to mitigate bias&#8221; (p. 378) crucial to the management of research.</li>
<li><strong>The passage is well written</strong> (3/3) &#8211; In sum, the article guides readers easily through the issues and study of SL, and presents the information engagingly.

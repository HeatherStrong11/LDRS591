For my blog posts this week I chose the article on servant leadership in the education system by Yusuf Cerit. I would rate the article a three in all categories. The explanations as to why are given below.

<pre><code>The study has a suitable choice for research design because it deals with a problem that can be clarified by way of mathematical means including mean and standard deviation. The way they chose the participants compliments the study. Almost six hundred teachers participated over a large range of schools within a specific province in Turkey. The way they went about collecting the data was appropriate and rigorous. In this case, the servant leadership scale (OLA) was carefully adapted to suit Turkey, including precise translation. Once this was done participants were given a survey with questions to rate on a scale of one to five for satisfaction. Once the data was collected a mean and standard deviation were found in order to properly scale the results. The data was then analyzed using charts and tables to show the calculations for each category. To name a few the list would include the development of people and intrinsic satisfaction. 

Lastly, the conclusion section contains both cause and effect. The cause of servant leadership has a positive effect on job satisfaction in the field of education. The relationship between principles and teachers appear to be healthier and rewarding.

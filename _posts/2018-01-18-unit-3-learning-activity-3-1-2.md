<p>Deepening College Students&#8217; Engagement with Religion and Theology through Community Service Learning</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>This study sought to determine whether students who participated in The Serve Program at Ignatius University were more likely to enrol in theological or religious courses. Students participate in a year long community service project that exposed them to poverty and inequality. Through this study, Seider attempted to provide empirical evidence that community service learning and religious interest are connected. Seider notes that while many related research articles are descriptive, there is a research literature gap regarding studies on this topic.</p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<p>There were 362 Ignatius University students signed up for the Serve Program in the 2008-09 year, as well as 37 students on the wait list. The students in the Serve Program and on the wait list completed surveys in September of 2008 and May of 2009. These surveys identified students interests in a variety of topics raised in the Serve Program, including students&#8217; interest in theology and religious studies. Students gave a response between one and five regarding their interest in specific subjects. Thirty random students were selected after the program to be interviewed. This interview collected information regarding the students&#8217; interest in a variety of topics related to the Serve Program, including their interest in theology and integrating spirituality into their life. The same surveys were done after the program was completed for these thirty students. The author notes that the group on the wait list was not interviewed.</p>
<p><strong>Results/Findings</strong></p>
<p>The study showed that participants were statistically much more inclined to take theology courses after the Serve program. Likewise, the Serve program also increased the participants&#8217; interest in theology. However, the Serve program did not have a considerable effect on participants&#8217; desire to practice religion. Finally, students were much more likely to engage in poverty-reduction efforts after taking the Serve program.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>The study showed that combining community service learning with university studies increased the participants&#8217; interest in theological studies and their engagement with community issues.</p>
<p><strong>Personal comments</strong></p>
<p>I found this study to be fascinating. Determining one&#8217;s interest in a subject is always difficult, but this study shows how it can be done effectively. Though the study has a conclusion, the author does note that a follow-up study determining how many students actually enrolled in theological studies as a result of the Serve program would be interesting. I agree with this, as I wonder if the results would be the same after a longer period of time had gone by. I am not entirely sure how this study would relate to my research question but it is clear that when people see and experience real world issues like poverty, their interest in theology increases. This may be something I can incorporate from a &#8220;consumer&#8221; point of view as well. Our engagement with issues often correlates to our awareness of issues. This study proves that point well.</p>

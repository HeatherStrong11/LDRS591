Great question Ruth, and one that there is no easy answer to. We are called to love our neighbour as our second command, and in that we should leave the judgement aside. We are followers of a God of Grace, though he is also a righteous and wrathful God, he does not call us to judge our neighbour, rather to love them. To quote an old love the sinner/ hate the sin. I guess that doesn&#8217;t really give a tangible answer to the problem, but it should be the focus in our decision making. Another thought I had was from John 15:18-25 where Jesus talks about the world hating us because of him, another is Matthew 10:22. I guess the best choice is to not worry about what the world thinks, but go out into the world of leadership with love, grace, and truth in all that we do.

Hey Simarjit, your question made me think of the news article I read about changes to the summer jobs grants policy that many religious organizations previously received but can no longer due to a conflict of ideologies. Organizations must now sign an attestation that they agree with abortion and sexual identity rights. https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/funding/canada-summer-jobs/eligibility.html<br />
While this is larger than dealing with a conflicting worldview issue at work, I feel it is a major shift in cultural morality on a large scale. Previously when one felt their worldview conflicted with an issue they were given an opportunity to abstain from participating but now as this issue becomes more politicized the outcome doesn&#8217;t seem that clear anymore. Even the TWU court case is relevant here as it is a conflict of worldview and the world has to decide which worldview they wish to support.

While I don&#8217;t think we can ever truly understand one another, the best way to resolve conflict is to try and understand each other&#8217;s point of view. The first step in the restitution model of conflict resolution is for each party to explain how they feel and why they feel that way. The second step is for each party to explain how the other party felt and why they felt that way. By understanding each others reasons and feelings we can begin to develop empathy for one another and in that empathy resolve our difference. It doesn&#8217;t always work, and sometimes there need be consequences and discipline to resolve conflict, but if people try to be empathetic, compassion will generally follow.

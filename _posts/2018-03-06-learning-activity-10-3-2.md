<p><strong>How can I know that I can trust what I am reading?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we can ever trust what we are reading entirely. There are certain measures that can build our trust in a source, such as the peer-review process, the credentials of the author and the organization funding or publishing the study, but as the quote in our notes section says, even the peer-review process is not always perfect (Locke, et al., 2010). Therefore, we should look for trustworthy sources based on the characteristics of the study listed above, but healthy skepticism of any source is always a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>How do I know the research has been performed competently?</strong></p>
<p>Reading the paper critically is the best way to determine this. Reading through the methods section to determine whether the study was conducted properly is key. Further, looking for the source to determine whether it is reputable, as well as making sure the research design adequately addresses the research question can help.</p>
<p><strong>How do I know the research is reported honestly?</strong></p>
<p>Once again, doing a little bit of digging into the source of the study, the author of the study and the overall purpose can help determine whether there is a conflict of interest or general bias. When a study does not include its limitations, this is also an immediate red flag as it assumes the study was conducted without error.</p>
<p><strong>How do I know the findings presented are consistent with what other researchers</strong></p>
<p><strong>would conclude?</strong></p>
<p>Many high quality papers will include a brief overview of the research done on the topic up to that point. I often look to make sure the study builds upon previous research and is not completely separate. Looking at other studies that are similar to determine whether there were different results can help as well.</p>
<p><strong>Close with one question that invites further comment and discussion.</strong></p>
<p>Determine whether a source is trustworthy can be a long process. If you could only determine whether a source can be trusted based on one thing (authorship, publication, date, etc.) what would it be? Or in other words, what is the most important element for you to determine a source&#8217;s reliability?</p>

<b>Direct quote, less than 40 words</b>

Seider (2011) explains, &#8220;the Serve Program began at Ignatius University in the 1970’s as an elective through which students could meet the university’s philosophy and theology requirements&#8221; (p. 206).

<strong>Direct quote, more than 40 words</strong>

After the program the students were interviewed again:

Interviews with thirty Serve participants reveal that the community service placements in            which they engaged through the Serve Program provided opportunities for these students          to witness poverty and inequality firsthand, in many cases for the first time in their lives.              Specifically, twenty-nine of the thirty interviewed students characterized their experiences          at their community service placements as having deepened their awareness of poverty              and inequality. (Seider, 2011, p. 215).

<strong>Paraphrased idea from an article</strong>

Interest in community service learning within colleges and universities is increasing, as more colleges are including programs similar to the Serve Program into their curriculum (Seider 2011).

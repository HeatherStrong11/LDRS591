<h3>Qualitative research Designs</h3>
<h4>What research design was used to guide the study? Was it justified?</h4>
<p>The research design used in Chan and So was a Narrative Research design (2017). Chan and So used the narrative research design to gain authenticity in their data, while providing a trusting relationship between the researcher and the participants, especially due to the fact that the participants are minors (2017. p. 21). While I understand their motive for doing a narrative research design, I am more partial to the Ethnographic Research design or the Grounded Research design when it comes to areas of Servant Leadership. Both Ethnographic Research Design and Grounded Research Design deal with culture and belief (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015. p. 294-297). That being said, the results of Chan and So&#8217;s narrative research could be more tangible and useable in a school setting. Quotes from participants can be used to further validate their findings when presenting their findings to the school body.</p>
<h4>Does the qualitative research design address the study’s purpose?</h4>
<p>The purpose of the study was to &#8220;cultivate servant leadership attributes among learners in secondary schooling&#8221; (Chan &amp; So, 2017. p. 19). While I rarely seek out Narrative Research studies, this study is attempting to grow servant leaders in a school setting. By telling stories, there is a more real connection between the participants and the reader. I assume the results of the study are being used as a tool to further this development among the participants and other students of the school. Narrative Research works well when trying to create empathy between the reader and the participant.</p>
<h4>Quality Rating and Rationale:</h4>
<p>I found this research article different than most I would normally read. That being said I rated it a 18/21 on the Rating Scale for Evaluating the Research Design in a Qualitative Research Report. I struggled a little with the choice of research design but for their purpose it was a valid and well researched article.</p>

##### Peer Review

For your assignments, you will be asked to exchange your work with a partner in the class and perform a peer review for each other. Your peer review should be collegial and address issues like grammar and structure as well as the quality of arguments and evidence presented in the paper.

Your feedback to your partner should be 150-250 words and may be provided in point form.

##### **Peer Review Protocol**

Your instructor will assign partners for each assignment and post the partnerships in the assignments forum in the learning management system.

Once your partner has posted their paper, download it to your own computer, read it, and make notes according to grammar, composition, and content as prescribed by the assignment. Make notes about the strengths of your partner's paper as well as areas to work on \(clarify, more analysis, more personal application\).

Summarize your notes in a response to your partner's forum post in 150-250 words**. **Please remember that your response will be visible to all members of the class in the forum.

###### Please remember! {#please-remember}

* Be Kind: Always treat others with dignity and respect. Never use words that are hurtful, including sarcasm.
* Be Specific: Focus on particular strengths and weaknesses, rather than making general comments like “It’s good” or “I like it.” Provide insight into why it is good or what, specifically, you like about it.
* Be Helpful: The goal is to positively contribute to the individual or the group, not to simply be heard. Echoing the thoughts of others or cleverly pointing out details that are irrelevant wastes time.
* Participate: Peer critique is a process to support each other, and your feedback is valued!
* When critiquing a peer’s work, use “I” statements. For example, “I’m confused by this part,” rather than “This part makes no sense.”
* Use questions whenever possible. For example
  * I’m curious why you chose to begin with…?
  * Did you consider adding…?
  * What evidence do you have for...?
* Remember the three important phrases:
  * "I notice...".
  * "I wonder...".
  * "If this were my work, I would...".

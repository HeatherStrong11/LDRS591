After taking this class I donâ€™t think I would make decisions slightly different than before. I also will be researching for said decisions with a more scrutinizing eye. I learned the most from the action research project in unit nine. I think knowing that there is more to just complaining about work issues over the dinner table is empowering. Knowing that if I go about a topic with a mindset of respect, inquiry, and hopes of making a situation better for everyone then my superiors will be more willing to hear me. In congruence with this, it is definitely an opportunity to step into a position of leadership and influence.

In my personal life, I enjoy going to the opera, watching movies, and visiting art galleries. I like these pastimes because they inspire in-depth conversations. In tune with this, I think I feel more capable and inclined to be apart of professional discussions on sources and possible action research projects. If a colleague or one of my professors at TWU is discussing sources I am more likely to understand when they say they found a source weak or strong. As an educator myself, I can now educate my students on the subject matter or increase my reliability with them when they ask what makes a source a good source.

I think from a larger perspective everyone should take a course similar to this because it enables people to not believe what they hear or see right away. For me, this course will probably make me more prone not just to second-guessing what I read in scholarly sources but media as well.

<strong>Article</strong>

The Influence of Servant Leadership on Restaurant Employee Engagement

<strong>Quality Criteria</strong>

1.A research design guides the conduct of the qualitative study.

<strong>Rate</strong>

2=Good

<strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong>

a) The researchers do not explicitly state the type of the research design, but they mention this article as a phenomenological study. Therefore, I believe this study adopts the case study research design.

b) The researchers correctly use several terms of a case study research design, such as themes. In addition, the research problem clearly calls for an in-depth exploration of understanding the influence of servant leadership on employee engagement from both a follower and leader perspective.

c) There is plenty of up-to-date literature cited in the study to support the research.

<strong>Quality Criteria</strong>

2.The choice of the research design is appropriate and justified.

<strong>Rate</strong>

3=Excellent

<strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong>

a) The two research questions are clearly presented in the introduction section that aim to explore two cases: one is to explore the experience of servant leadership through lived-experience, the other one is to explore the experience and perception of employees.

b) The researchers illustrate the reason why the phenomenological study is used in this study right after the two research questions.

<strong>Quality Criteria</strong>

3.Good qualitative data collection procedures are used.

<strong>Rate</strong>

3=Excellent

<strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong>

a) The procedures include collecting focus group data and documented data, direct and non-obtrusive observations, and interviews. The procedures are appropriate for the case study research design.

b) I think the procedures are used rigorously, although I have not finished reading chapter 10.

<strong>Quality Criteria</strong>

4.Good qualitative data analysis procedures are used.

<strong>Rate</strong>

3=Excellent

<strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong>

a) The researchers use a seven-step process to analyze data and they state that this process has led to findings and themes based on the analyzed data.

b) The researchers particularly identify the five themes in a section. Although I am not familiar with the procedures of analyzing themes, I think they are rigorous.

<strong>Quality Criteria</strong>

5.Good qualitative results and interpretations are reported.

<strong>Rate</strong>

3=Excellent

<strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong>

a) The results section includes a rich description of the focus group responses and a thorough presentation of the themes.

b) Although I am not familiar with the procedures of analyzing results, I think  they are rigorous.

<strong>Quality Criteria</strong>

6.The study used a rigorous research design.

<strong style="font-size: 1rem">Rate</strong>

2=Good

<strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong>

Given the qualitative design is a case study research design, most of the elements of a case study design could be identified are depicted in a logical and coherent way.

<strong>Quality Criteria</strong>

7.The use of the qualitative research design addressed the study&#8217;s purpose.

<strong style="font-size: 1rem">Rate</strong>

3=Excellent

<strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong>

The researchers analyze the findings from different aspects, and all the findings provide a rich exploration that answers the study&#8217;s research questions.

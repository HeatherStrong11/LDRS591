<p><strong>Article</strong></p>
<p>The Influence of Servant Leadership on Restaurant Employee Engagement</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>1.A research design guides the conduct of the qualitative study.</p>
<p><strong>Rate</strong></p>
<p>2=Good</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) The researchers do not explicitly state the type of the research design, but they mention this article as a phenomenological study. Therefore, I believe this study adopts the case study research design.</p>
<p>b) The researchers correctly use several terms of a case study research design, such as themes. In addition, the research problem clearly calls for an in-depth exploration of understanding the influence of servant leadership on employee engagement from both a follower and leader perspective.</p>
<p>c) There is plenty of up-to-date literature cited in the study to support the research.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>2.The choice of the research design is appropriate and justified.</p>
<p><strong>Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) The two research questions are clearly presented in the introduction section that aim to explore two cases: one is to explore the experience of servant leadership through lived-experience, the other one is to explore the experience and perception of employees.</p>
<p>b) The researchers illustrate the reason why the phenomenological study is used in this study right after the two research questions.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>3.Good qualitative data collection procedures are used.</p>
<p><strong>Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) The procedures include collecting focus group data and documented data, direct and non-obtrusive observations, and interviews. The procedures are appropriate for the case study research design.</p>
<p>b) I think the procedures are used rigorously, although I have not finished reading chapter 10.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>4.Good qualitative data analysis procedures are used.</p>
<p><strong>Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) The researchers use a seven-step process to analyze data and they state that this process has led to findings and themes based on the analyzed data.</p>
<p>b) The researchers particularly identify the five themes in a section. Although I am not familiar with the procedures of analyzing themes, I think they are rigorous.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>5.Good qualitative results and interpretations are reported.</p>
<p><strong>Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) The results section includes a rich description of the focus group responses and a thorough presentation of the themes.</p>
<p>b) Although I am not familiar with the procedures of analyzing results, I think  they are rigorous.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>6.The study used a rigorous research design.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem">Rate</strong></p>
<p>2=Good</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>Given the qualitative design is a case study research design, most of the elements of a case study design could be identified are depicted in a logical and coherent way.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>7.The use of the qualitative research design addressed the study&#8217;s purpose.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem">Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>The researchers analyze the findings from different aspects, and all the findings provide a rich exploration that answers the study&#8217;s research questions.</p>
<p><strong>Total Score = 19 (17-21 = High quality)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Author:</strong></p>
<p>Herbert W. Broda, Ph.D. is a professor emeritus of education at Ashland University in Ohio where he teaches courses with a focus on middle school education, instructional methods, and outdoor education at both the graduate and undergraduate level.</p>
<p><strong>Is the source up to date?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it was published in 2011.</p>
<p><strong>What are the intentions of the author? Who is the intended audience?</strong></p>
<p>Moving the Classroom Outdoors: Schoolyard-Enhanced Learning in action builds on his first book, Schoolyard-Enhanced learning, published in 2006. Broda wrote Moving the Classroom Outdoors to provide teachers and school administrators practical ideas how they can enhance the learning experience of their students by using the whole school, both inside and outdoors. Broda provides helpful ideas, tips, and guides for schools in an urban, suburban, or rural setting. The book discusses the use of technology and how to integrate technology into outdoor education to enhance student experience and learning.</p>
<p><strong>Publication type/Process – Who published the article? Was the article peer reviewed?</strong></p>
<p>It was published by Stenhouse Publishers located in Portland, Maine.  Stenhouse provides professional development resources for educators to inspire independent, critical, and creative thinking in their students.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any obvious biases and/or special interests that the author acknowledges?</strong></p>
<p>The contents of the book were developed through Broda’s experience as an elementary school teacher, his work at Ashland University, and countless conversations with teachers, administrators, students, and through a partner with schools across North America to develop an outdoor education program to inspire students and connect them with nature.</p>

Hey there! My name is Oliver Parsons. I grew up in the east kootenays in Cranbrook, but now live in Kelowna with my wife who I married last March. I am passionate about church ministry and am involved in a number of ways in my church. I also work part time in a coffee shop that is connected to a charity that helps give counselling and life coaching to people who canâ€™t afford it. I love good coffee, especially when it helps people!

I am also extremely into disc golfing (or frisbee golf)!

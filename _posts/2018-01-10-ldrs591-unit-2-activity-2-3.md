<p>I chose Donata Christiane Nilsen&#8217;s (2012) article, &#8220;Building &amp; Enhancing Interorganizational Relationship for Disaster Preparedness and Response Capacity: a Study of Community-based Organizations Serving Vulnerable Populations; a Focus on the Homeless.&#8221; The article can be found here:Â https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5tp4f30n</p>
<p>The following is my assessment of Nilsen&#8217;s (2012) article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Authority &#8211; At the time of its writing, the author, Donata Christiane Nilsen, was a Doctor of Public Health candidate in the Graduate Division of the University of California, Berkeley. This study was completed as a dissertation in requirements for her degree and was overseen by a committee of professors from the university. Although her university provides Nilsen a level of authority, a quick Google search reveals little of her credentials, past writing experience, and expertise.</li>
<li>Currency &#8211; The article was published in 2012, which meets the rule of utilizing current sources that date back no longer than 10 years.</li>
<li>Purpose &#8211; As stated, the article was written for the completion of Nilsen&#8217;s Doctor of Public Health degree. The dissertation&#8217;s audience was Nilson&#8217;s educators in the university, but Nilsen (2012) also states the purpose of her study was to explore &#8220;the relationship between the number and types of interorganizational relationships that [community-based organizations (&#8220;CBOs&#8221;)] use to serve clients&#8221; (p.1). This suggests its intention for a public audience amongst the non-profit sector, and reinforces the research she conducted through surveys and interviews for findings. The tone and language of the article suggests the author&#8217;s impartiality as it speaks of its findings and research methods rather than anecdotal stories.</li>
<li>Content: This research article communicates a research question, research method, results, and answers the research question. It is backed by 6.5 pages of references, and appendixes that exemplify the research questions and resources used. This suggests a well-structured and research-based study.</li>
<li>Publication Type/Process: Though Berkeley University is a reputable university, the article was published by a university press and not a large publisher. Despite that, the source is peer-reviewed.</li>
<li>Bias and Special Interests: As Nilsen is seeking a Doctoral in Public Health, there may be biases towards the selection of organizations selected to participate in the study and the concluding benefits of interorganizationial relationships with CBOs.</li>

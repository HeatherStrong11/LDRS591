<p><strong>Did the researchers use at least three strategies to validate the findings?</strong></p>
<p>It was not explicitly written, but the authors may have performed some form of bracketing, as Chan &amp; So wrote, “these two researchers are conscious of researcher biases, and aim to generate evidence-based interpretations of the subjects.” (2017, p. 21) However, the authors did not explicitly use any of the four strategies listed in Plano-Clarke &amp; Creswell, bracketing, triangulation, member checking, and an audit. However, Plano-Clarke acknowledges there are “many different strategies for validating their qualitative findings in reports.” (2015, p. 364) Overall, Chan &amp; So could have done a better jump validating and showing the trustworthiness of their report.</p>

<p><strong>Did the findings include a good description of the people, places, or events in the study?</strong></p>
<p>The authors provide general details of the people such as their age and place of education. However, they provide no specific details about the individuals, classes, or school. The authors should have provided additional details to create a detailed picture of the participants, events and the study.</p>

<p><strong>Did the findings include appropriate themes about the central phenomenon?</strong></p>
<p>Chan &amp; So identified seven themes from their coding: listening, empathy, empathy, empathy and healing, awareness, planning: conceptualization and foresight, persuasion, and community building. (2017, p. 22) Plano-Clarke &amp; Creswell suggest five to seven themes indicate a higher quality of qualitative research. (2015, p. 377)</p>

<p><strong>Did the findings provide a good exploration of the central phenomenon?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chan &amp; So dissected the seven themes into subthemes to provide a further understanding of the data and answer their two research questions. The study confirmed servant leadership training can be a part of a secondary school co-curriculum program. The researchers provided a general understanding about how servant leadership can be developed in students aged 15 to 17. Overall, Chan &amp; So provide a basic framework for how the development of servant leaders could look in secondary schools. The authors provide clear explanations of the three stages of servant leadership training, serve, lead, and build, and how they connect with the seven themes found throughout the coding process.</p>

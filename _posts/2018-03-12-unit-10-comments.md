When the Author of the study is out to propagate an invalid argument it is our duty to question their motive and provide honesty in response to them. We should call their motive into question, and provide examples of more honest research. The point of peer review is to prevent dishonest researchers from propagating myths. When dishonest researchers do this, peers must reveal their dishonesty to the world to prevent the continuation of bad practice.

The answer is too many times&#8230; &#8220;Laernign Activity&#8221;. To answer your first: While I haven&#8217;t experienced any life shattering worldview crushing awakenings in the research process, I have been reminded to assess bias and validity with more scrutiny and have been challenged to provided research through action research plans, etc, rather than just be a reader of research. I feel that through this course my mind has been opened to the possibility of providing research in areas of interest that the peer community might be lacking.

I hope Dr Strong answers your question, as I am also curious as to the protocol when the research is flawed. I feel like a good first step might be reaching out to the journal where the article is published. It is probably more curious to reach out to the author, but it is the duty of the journal to assess the articles for validity. It is probably best to contact both the author and the journal. That being said, I have no idea what the right answer is, and again, I am hoping Dr Strong provides some clarity in this as you have piqued my curiosity.

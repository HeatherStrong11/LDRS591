<strong>What sampling strategy is used and is it appropriate and justified?</strong>

Russell, E. J., Maxfield, R. J., &amp; Russell, J. L. (2017) selected theory sampling as a good purposeful sampling strategy, they were “14 senior level leaders from multiple for-profit organizations headquartered in the Western United States” (p.84). The justification for this choice was clearly to elicit theoretical discovery involving data and analysis from pre-selected specific experts (Russell et al., 2017, p.85). They relied on data saturation to determine the sample size. The participants accessed the questionnaire anonymously through an online database; these questions were open-ended questions which an example of data type under interview category (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2017, p.338).

Rate 3

<strong>Is the sample size appropriate?</strong>

According to Plano-Clerk &amp;Creswell, 2017, p.336), “There are no strict rules for sample size in qualitative research,” however they included a guideline in grounded theory study. Therefore, they chose a decent number to conduct the study; saturation point reached when no longer learning new information. The 14 participants selected from several organizational positions in the For-profit sector, which represent a pre-selected expert which will help researcher forming the theoretical findings.

Rate 2

<strong>Is the data collected appropriately? Do the data types are appropriate?</strong>

The researchers used an open-ended question to learn about participants experience and perspectives. “The script avoided key terms and language that could compel participants to answer questions in a specific way to avoid researcher bias” (Russell et al., 2017, p.84). They also included specific script about areas of focus and sources. “The pilot study allowed the researchers to edit and refine the questions to develop a rich and meaningful script for the actual research study” (Russell et al., 2017, p.85).

Rate 6

<strong>Are the data gathered ethically and thoughtfully?</strong>

The researchers removed any personal identifiers, which was a step taken by researchers to protect participants anonymity. “The researchers triangulated data sources from multiple participants and had another researcher perform an analysis for comparison, and presented the data in-depth, rich descriptions in the results section” (Russell et al., 2017, p.85). The researchers also obtained permission from their University Institutional Review Board to conduct this study and the pilot study. The participation in the study was voluntary and took less than 30 minutes.

Rate 3

<strong>Were the selected participants information-rich?</strong>

The site and participants fit the study purpose. The participants provided rich information that formed the theoretical findings.

Rate 3

<strong>Was the database providing extensive and credible information about the central phenomenon?</strong>

The multiple types of open-ended questions were explicit and related to the central phenomenon and the study of intents; therefore the participation in the study was voluntary and took less than 30 minutes to complete.

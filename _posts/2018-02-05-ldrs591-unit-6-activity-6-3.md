<p>E. Russell, Maxfield, and J. Russell’s (2017) study is evaluated based on Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell’s (2015) seven criteria for evaluating the data analysis of a qualitative research report (p.  301) below:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The analysis process used rigorous qualitative procedures (2/3) &#8211; </strong>Russell et al. (2017) sorted and analyzed the data using a hand coding process (p. 86) that involved &#8220;a lot of time reading and rereading the data&#8221; (p. 86), but failed to provide &#8220;verbatim transcripts and electronic scans of all gathered data&#8221; (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 377).</li>
<li><strong>Strategies were used to validate the findings (2/3) &#8211; </strong>Russell et al. (2017) used triangulation to validate their results, and &#8220;had another researcher preform an analysis for comparison&#8221; (p. 86). Despite this, there is not a clear indication of the researchers using at least three of the four strategies Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015) identified as crucial to validating results: bracketing, triangulation, member checking, and audits.</li>
<li><strong>The findings include a description of people, places, or events in the study (1/3) &#8211; </strong>The study provides details on each participants&#8217; organizational position and for-profit sector as shown in Table 2 (Russell et al., 2017, p. 85), and general information on the age range, sex, and location of the study. Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015) state, &#8220;A good qualitative description [&#8230;] should transport you into the context of the research and help you get to know the people, setting, or events that are important in the study&#8221; (p. 366). Due to the researcher&#8217;s emphasis on anonymity, there are broad but not many narrow descriptions. While I feel the study still provides a general idea of its participants, further details on the people and setting of the organizations would have benefited the study.</li>
<li><strong>The findings include appropriate themes about the central phenomenon (2/3) &#8211; </strong>There are seven meaningful themes identified in the two attributes found in the results that are supported by multiple quotes and perspectives. A comparison table and further interpretation from the researchers&#8217; voice would have benefited this area.</li>
<li><strong>The findings relate multiple themes to each other (3/3) &#8211; </strong>The themes are linked through the two attributes identified: 1) validation as a leader, and 2) freedom from management. There are multiple layers of categories within the two attributes that connect consistently to the central question of how &#8220;senior leaders interpret the personal benefits derived from serving the needs of followers&#8221; (Russell et al., 2017, p. 76).</li>
<li><strong>The data analysis represents a good qualitative process (2/3) &#8211; </strong>The data analysis involved a dynamic coding process that involved open codes, axial codes, and selective codes that were interpreted based on the data collected. The researchers reveal a credible process with relatively accurate results despite a low sample number and limitations created by the questionnaire such as &#8220;discovering how these leaders arrived at their position of leadership&#8221; (Russell et al., 2017, p. 93).</li>
<li><strong>The findings provide a good exploration of the central phenomenon (2/3) &#8211; </strong>The findings provide detailed information in understanding &#8220;the benefits to one&#8217;s self-interest from being a servant leader&#8221; (Russell et al., 2017, p. 93). Overall, the findings were well focused on the study&#8217;s research question and added to the discussion of servant leadership.</li>

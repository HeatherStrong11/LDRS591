<strong>CLEARING THE FOG</strong>

There appear to be sufficient reasons out their, I choose peer reviews articles and ebook through TWU accessed database library, and I would like to reveal more in-depth study for the name of the author and organization responsible for the information. I deemed to One way to recognize that Internet URLs are hierarchical and that the slashes in an address (/) define levels of the hierarchy in the search.

Google phrases option that I tried was achieving with AND search. However, I choose TWU search engine &#8220;Academic Search Complete&#8221; to scholarly (Peer Review) Journals to meet my research interest.

I learned from Dr. William Badke “Clearing the fog” I evaluate the credibility of the source and their credential as I choose in my search scholarly peer review Journals, the citation of the article and publication including the year, related articles.

I did search the author(s) of the chosen site and articles for a vested interest in promoting a viewpoint or sharing information. I choose to collect what may help me clarifying my research interest to the extended notion of what it makes sense for resolution through studied strategies, and functional language and analytical thinking needed for my search and not being biased.  I also checked the google scholar and an online google search engine which brought me to the point that I can use the same method either ways.

Some journals found in my research engine that I have the interest to include, and as the first step in learning and writing literature, I may need articles to find the relation between an organization, servant leadership, and employee.

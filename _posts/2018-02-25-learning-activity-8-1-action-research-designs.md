<h3>Action Research Designs</h3>

The first practical issue I found at my current school is the lack of teachers on call. The problem is there is a shortage of adequately trained teachers to cover for full time teachers. When there is an absence the administration and other teachers must cover the absent teacher&#8217;s classes. This problem appears to be a direct result of a shortage of teachers across the province, but there is a greater shortage of teachers on call in our school than in other areas.

The second practical issue is that many students have become coddled. What I mean by that is there is a grown number of students in my school with what could be defined as helicopter parents. The fear I have is that the students are not learning independence due to the significant parental support given the students, and as a result of this the students do not take ownership of their failures.

The third practical issue I often see teaching is the need for more activity breaks scattered throughout the day. As younger students work to remain on task, their bodies require stimulation to help keep them on task. Often students can be seen fighting, or tapping in order to receive this internal pressure to move around. How could we as teachers be more aware of this need and provide the students with more exercise breaks.

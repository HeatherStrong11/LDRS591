<p>This is a response to Simarjit Shergill&#8217;s post <a href="https://create.twu.ca/icandothis/2018/02/01/ldrs-591-activit-5-4/">https://create.twu.ca/icandothis/2018/02/01/ldrs-591-activit-5-4/</a></p>
<p>Question: I find myself instinctively trusting studies that use validate instruments. Is it fair to judge a study as falling short if the authors create their own instrument/s , as long as they attempt to include all the variables they are studying ?</p>
<p>I think it depends on the different situation to believe whether or not the instrument created by the authors is reliable.</p>
<p>Before illustrating my ideas, I would like to first emphasize the significance of critical thinking. Cultivating critical thinking is the principal thing I have gained from the reflection in this week. No matter what kind of article we are reviewing, we should adopt the academic attitude of being critical with the information provided by the authors. Evidently, the instruments and statistics would seem to be more reliable and valid if the article is peer-reviewed or the instruments have been testified by other authorities before. While it does not mean the instrument developed by the researchers themselves cannot be trusted.</p>
<p>First, the instruments existing to date is limited, but the number of unexplored research questions is unknown. Clearly, we need far more instruments. Therefore, more instruments have to be created and examined to solve the various questions in the world. Second, we can inspect the instrument created by the authors in the study according to our critical thinking. For example, we can check if the instrument is designed in a rigorous way; if the procedures of the instrument are presented in a logical way. More important, if the instrument has been testified and examined by the creator or creators many times before using it to analyze real problems, and if the reports of the experiments are presented in the study. Third, we have to consider the validity of the study in a comprehensive way rather than only thinking about the instruments and the variables. For instance, the way of collecting the data, the type of the research design, the participants, the analysis of the results, and the limitations should all be taken into account.</p>
<p>At last, I would like to introduce an article as an example in which the instrument is developed by the authors themselves and used in the study. I happened to find this article during searching for the journal articles for the second assignment. I finally chose this article and read it carefully several weeks ago. From my personal perspective, this article is of high quality and the instrument is designed perfectly for the research question. If you are interested in reading it, the title of the article is <em>School-Based Intervention for Adolescents with Social Anxiety Disorder: Results of a Controlled Study. </em>I hope this article would be helpful.</p>

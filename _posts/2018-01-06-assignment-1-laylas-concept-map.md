<p>As depicted in my concept map, listening to the music, reading, learning psychology, and teaching are the four principal interests of myself. I listen to all kinds of music, especially like country music, R&amp;B, and opera. I also prefer to listen to music when reading a novel on the couch. Actually, not only novel, I read a wide range of books, including arts and photography, children’s books, education and teaching, history, and parenting and relationships. I always deem that reading can help build my knowledge reservoir, which provides a sound basis for analyzing problems, making decisions, and reflecting on my conducts to improve myself. Furthermore, I love psychology, although it requires an advanced level of professional knowledge. Psychology has helped me genuinely know myself. With the knowledge gained from psychology, I found out that due to the issues of my family I have several psychological problems. I could finally face my temper issues and anxiety issues, stop pushing myself so hard and blaming myself. Especially the very first moment when I saw my own son, I decided to bring up him with both physical health and mental health. At last, I would like to be a teacher one day. I like teaching, not only because I am willing to pass the knowledge to all the students to help them become better versions of themselves, but also teacher embodies servant leadership which I highly respect and admire.</p>
<p>Considering the interconnections between different aspects and the correlations among them, I conclude three potential research questions that can better represent my preferences of the direction of the future research.</p>
<ul>
<li>Research Question 1. As a teacher in an elementary school or a secondary school, how to well manage the mental issues of the children and pass the professional knowledge to them at the same time?</li>
<li>Research Question 2. What kind of role is music playing in the process of psychological counselling and how important is it?</li>
<li>Research Question 3. As a psychological counsellor, how to genuinely diagnose his or her own mental issues and handle them in a rational way?</li>
</ul>
<p>I would select Research Question 1 as the strongest one to pursue a future research paper. According to the visible and invisible features of the question, I would search literature from the fields of education, psychology, relationships, and leadership.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons that I choose Question 1. First of all, mental health is as important as physical health, yet has been underestimated by most of the people in the world. In my observation of the other people and my experience, a mental health person will evidently perceive far more happiness, peace, and sense of security than other ones. Secondly, it is better for a person to be aware of his or her mental issues and repair the psychological trauma in his or her early age (Greven, 1990). I suppose that it would be terrific if the teachers equipped with the psychological knowledge could notice the mental issues of the students in time and give them the proper guidance during the school time.</p>

<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I just wanted to remind you that Assignment #3 (Literature Review Search) is coming up and due on Feb 12th.  I answered quite a few questions from my face to face class in Langley about this assignment, so I wanted to give you some suggestions before you start the assignment.  So here we go:</p>
<ol>
<li>On average, it will take you 8-9 hours to complete the assignment.</li>
<li>Use the research question that you created for assignment #1 to guide your search for assignment #3.</li>
<li>Start by searching everything on your topic in Library One Search.  Record your results in a table like Table 1 on the assignment instructions.  You do not need to record everything!  Just select 3-5 examples that are related to your topic. &#8220;Number of hits&#8221; means number of results.</li>
<li>Next, search a specific academic database through the TWU library.  Select 10 sources that you think will be relevant for your topic.  Record your results in a table like Table 2 on the assignment instructions. You will need to read the title and abstracts of articles that you think are relevant to your research question (you do not have to read the entire article for this assignment).</li>
<li>Next, search google scholar.  Record your results in a table like Table 3 on the assignment instructions.  You do not need to record everything!  Just select 3-5 examples that are related to your topic. &#8220;Number of hits&#8221; means number of results.</li>
<li>In total you should have approximately 15 usable sources that are relevant to your research question (up to a maximum of 20).</li>
<li>Yes, APA formatting is required for this assignment here is what I am looking for:
<ol>
<li>Please include a title page.</li>
<li>The main body of the assignment should be organized with proper section headings (e.g., Library one search, Academic database search, Google scholar search, Preliminary investigation summary).</li>
<li>A reference list of the 15 sources that you have listed in the assignment.</li>
<li>Proper in-text citations (especially in your preliminary investigation summary).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any other questions, do not hesitate to contact me.</p>

<h3>Battling Bad Science</h3>
<h4>How can I know that I can trust what I am reading?</h4>
<p>One can never fully trust what one is reading to be 100% accurate, though, with the peer review process or the process of judging a dissertation, there is far more accountability into the honesty and accuracy of the research methodology. Not all research is equal, not all articles are equal. When reviewing the research, one must be aware of common perception in the field in regards to the research, evaluate bias and assess the source for validity. Plano-Clark and Crewel (2015) provides many assessment tools for research methodology as we have learnt in this course.</p>
<h4>How do I know the research has been performed competently?</h4>
<p>Through evaluating the source of the research, both the researcher&#8217;s qualifications and the journal in which it is published, one can begin to understand the credibility of the author and the publication. From there one ought to assess the article through tools like those provided by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) to judge whether the research is done in a valid and professional manner.</p>
<h4>How do I know the research is reported honestly?</h4>
<p>One hopes the research is both preformed competently and reported honestly in all occurrences, though given human nature this is unlikely. Again through the evaluation of the authority of the researcher, and their research methodology one can understand the outcome of their results. However, to truly grasp the research and find it to be honest research, one must also be aware of similar research preformed by others with similar results. Through the citation process, one can find a trail of research that provided support and validity to a researcher&#8217;s subject matter. Again, one must evaluate bias and motive in both the researcher and the funding behind the research, and view the research in the light of peer understanding.</p>
<h4>How do I know the findings presented are consistent with what other researchers would conclude?</h4>
<p>Follow the trail of citations. Good researchers always have support from their peers in all parts of their research process. They may use previously defined assessment methods and cite them, or previously agreed on definitions by peers. Regardless of how researchers use the research of their peers, it is expected that they do in order to provide validity and peer support to their research. To truly understand the evidence found in a research article, one must review the research and opinions of others to provide a vast perspective on the subject. You can never read just one article on a topic.</p>
<h4>Question for discussion:</h4>
<p>Aside from modern examples of &#8220;Fake News&#8221; where media spins research for their own benefit, does anyone have any examples of journal articles that are obviously examples of bad research. What have you come across in your research that could be used as an example of biased or dishonest research?</p>

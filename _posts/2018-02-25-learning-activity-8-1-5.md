<p>Like many people, I want to be in control, but far too often I find myself in a situation I can control. The only thing I can control is how I respond to a given situation or problem that I face. With that said, I am a fan of Action Research Designs as it provides a simple model to address issues directly one might encounter in their professional life. In other words, there is no reason to complain about this and that but instead, find a solution to the problem. Here are three problems my school currently faces:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attendance – Student social-emotional learning and academic growth are negatively affected by absenteeism. If students are not absent, then they are usually late. Currently, our school does not have attendance or late policy.</li>
<li>School community – The lack of school community and positive school culture plays a part in student achievement, demotivates staff who already live in difficult circumstances in an isolated community. A healthy school community will promote parent engagement and community partnerships, character development, safe and healthy schools, and provide an opportunity to hear our students’ voices.</li>
<li>Parent engagement – parents and guardians, are the most important teachers to their children. As a school, we have failed to engage and included parents in their children&#8217;s’ education effectively. Parents play a vital role in their child’s education. When parents, teachers, and students come together in a shared vision, everyone will benefit including students, parents, teachers and community members.</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe all three problems are deeply connected and if you solve one, the other will also improve. Unfortunately, it is easier said than done, but I look forward to the challenge ahead.</p>

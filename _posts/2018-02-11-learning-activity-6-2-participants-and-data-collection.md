<h3>Participants and Data Collection</h3>

<h4>What sampling strategy is used and is it appropriate and justified?</h4>

A homogenous sampling was used for this research study. According to Chan and So 14 secondary students signed up for the leadership program and of those 14, 11 took part in the research study (2017. p.20). All 14 students were classified as student leaders by the primary grades they were helping (2017. p.20). While a more diverse group of students might give more clarity, the purpose of the research is to develop servant leadership within the researcher&#8217;s school. The sample group provides appropriate diversity for the researcher&#8217;s purpose.

<h4>Is the sample size appropriate?</h4>

My bias is to study larger and more diverse groups, however, according to Plano-Clark and Creswell the &#8220;ability of a researcher to provide an in-depth exploration diminishes with the addition of each new site and individual&#8221; (2015. p.335). Chan and So studied an appropriate group diversity and size for the purpose of their research.

<h4>Is the data collected appropriate?</h4>

Chan and So preformed focus group interviews with the intent of providing a safe and trustworthy atmosphere where the participants would feel comfortable responding to the questions honestly rather than giving the answers the researchers hoped for(2017. p. 21). The recorded interviews provided appropriate data that could be analyzed thematically.

<h4>Are the data gathered ethically and thoughtfully?</h4>

Chan and So made the three focus groups interviews optional, which I assume is why only 11 of the 14 students participated (2017. p.20). They ensured the participants had given their written permission to be interviewed and recorded for the purpose of research(2017. p.21). The only ethical issue that I could see was being that the participants were minors did Chan and So receive permission to participate from the parents as well as the students.

<h4>Quality Rating:</h4>

I gave the article 17/21 on the Rating Scale for Evaluating the Participants and Data Collection in a Qualitative Research Report (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015. p. 350). While it is a High Quality research report, I gave the Data collection issues are handled ethically and thoughtfully a 1 (fair) as ethically permission to participate must be given by a parent or guardian when the participants are minors. I could not give it a 0 as the rest of the research was very ethical and I fell that this probably isn&#8217;t as big a deal ethically as I view it.

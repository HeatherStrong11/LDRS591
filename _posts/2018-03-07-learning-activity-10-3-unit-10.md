<strong>How can I know that I can trust what I am reading?</strong>

Evaluation of the articles based on peer-review, the credentials of the author, academic honors, holding positions of influence, association with major discoveries and longevity in the field are important factors in establishing an authorial reputation. Are the findings presented consistent with what other researchers would conclude (Locke, et al., 2010, p. 12)?. This question brings lots of attention to too many things considered when reading articles. The competency of the article has a vested contribution to the reader trust.

<strong>How do I know the research has been performed competently?</strong>

First, A rigorous research design shows all elements of the study fit together logically and coherently. Understanding how to critique the study is significant, and the findings presented should be consistent with what other researchers would conclude.

Second, Method of collection informs the consumer and conveys the details of data analysis process.

Finally, Does the sample truly represent the population?. Goldacre (2011) considered author’s authority and validity of data being collected it’s a sign of competency. Also, the results answered the research questions. Thus, research allows for replication.

<strong>How do I know the research is reported honestly?</strong>

Validating findings ensure accuracy and credibility. When authors include the limitations, weakness and strength, a suggestion for using research results to further research. Any errors occurred and reported during the study, which most of the researchers include these issues to explain their results. (Goldacre, 2011) Advised, &#8221; to lift up the lid, fingering around at the mechanics, and peer in.”

<strong>How do I know the findings presented are consistent with what other researchers would conclude?</strong>

Comparing the findings with other replicated study, explained the quality of the results and how it&#8217;s logically well-supported.  Many researchers include what was done in previous studies, and what they are going to do to answer their research questions.

<h3>The Most Important Factors in the Introduction of a Research Report</h3>

While there are a myriad of factors that influence the development of a research report, the introduction and abstract are the factors that most influence the reader. It is essential that the author of the research report write with clarity of purpose and well defined problems. The author must include an interesting topic that has a meaningful problem. The author must show the validity of their work through citations of peers. These citations may be used to justify the reason for their study or to support the findings of their study. The author must write in a logical manor that is clearly laid out using headings and titles. Â When viewing the author&#8217;s methodology we ought to look for variables that they might not have taken into account when beginning their research. It is very important to question the author&#8217;s bias when reading articles and understand their presupposed notions. We must do this as we read so that we the reader can view the research from a factual perspective, rather than one affected by bias.

<h3>Discussion Question:</h3>

When reading an introduction, do the amount of citations affect your perspective on the validity of the author&#8217;s purpose? Often when I see many citations in the introduction I feel that it subconsciously influences me to agree that the author&#8217;s perspective must be valid if so many people have the same idea.

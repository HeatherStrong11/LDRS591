<p><strong>Article</strong></p>
<p>The relationship between the servant leadership behaviors of immediate supervisors and follower’s perceptions of being empowered in the context of small business.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>1.The choice of the research design is appropriate and justified.</p>
<p><strong>Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) The design perfectly fits the study&#8217;s intent of measuring the relationship between followers&#8217; perceptions of the servant leadership of their immediate supervisor and the followers&#8217; sense of empowerment in the context of small businesses.</p>
<p>b) The researchers focus on describing the relationship between two main variables (servant leadership behaviors of an immediate supervisor, perceived follower empowerment) in a correlational design.</p>
<p>c) The literature presented by the authors is more prescriptive and acts as strong convincing explanation for why the correlational design is provided.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>2. Good quantitative procedures are used to select and assign participants.</p>
<p><strong>Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>The way that the participants are recruited totally fits the correlational design:</p>
<p>a) The authors recruit the participants who are conveniently available.</p>
<p>b) The participants are willing to take the survey or willing to take part in the study.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>3. Good quantitative data collection procedures are used.</p>
<p><strong>Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) This study is approved by the institutional review board prior for the data collection.</p>
<p>b) The authors make a survey, and the survey link is sent to possible participants. The participants send the survey link to possible participants as well. Therefore, the study provides a wide range of responses for the variables of interest.</p>
<p>c) The authors receive 130 surveys, and 116 are usable.</p>
<p>d) There is no manipulating the experiences of the participants in this study.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>4. Good quantitative data analysis procedures are used.</p>
<p><strong>Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) The quantitative survey used in this study contains two instruments: the Essential Servant Leadership Behaviors (ESLB) and the Conditions of Work Effectiveness Questionnaire II (CWEQ II).</p>
<p>b) The ESLB measures the independent variable, and the CWEQ II measures the dependent variable.</p>
<p>c) The Pearson Product-Moment (PPM) correlation coefficient is used to measure the relationship between the two variables and each subscale.</p>
<p>d) The authors use a table to present the correlation of each subscale with servant leadership behaviors. The table also displays information about the relationships among variables.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>5. Good quantitative results and conclusions are reported.</p>
<p><strong>Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) Claims made are appropriate for the design.</p>
<p>b) The authors claim that the causality cannot be assumed.</p>
<p>c) The study examines that the servant leadership behaviors have a strong correlation with followers&#8217; perceptions that they are empowered.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>6. The study used a rigorous research design.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem">Rate</strong></p>
<p>2=Good</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) All elements of the study from problem to purpose to methods to results to conclusions fit the correlational design in a logical way.</p>
<p>b) The Data Collection section is not very concise and a little disordered. The authors have not specified the difference between possible participants and participants.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>7. The use of the quantitative research design addressed the study&#8217;s purpose</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem">Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) The results and conclusions from the research design provide a rigorous explanation of the relationship of the variables that fulfills the study&#8217;s intent.</p>
<p>b) The analysis of the limitations of this study also addresses the deficiency of the correlational research design.</p>

<p>This is a response to <a href="https://create.twu.ca/icandothis/2018/02/11/ldrs-591-activity-6-4-2/">Simarjit&#8217;s post</a> question: Since the qualitative process is ‘explorative’ and ‘evolves’ along the way, the results could be interpreted in different ways. Since the reader doesn’t always have access to the analysis tools or programs used by the researchers, how does the reader reconcile their interpretation with that of the researchers? Seems like trust in the researchers is an important element to the consumer of qualitative research.</p>
<p>Simarjit,</p>
<p>You are right that qualitative research is exploratory and evolves. I see the evolution of the research in the contradicting results found from one study to another that find differing results due to culture, the social beliefs in the time of history they conduct the study, or other factors. For example, I explored studies analyzing female leadership this past week and found a range of data that found women were equally capable or less capable than men in leading. Studies in the past reflected the social beliefs of leadership being a masculine characteristics, while more recent studies reflect the growing acknowledgement of women&#8217;s capabilities. Research is continually building and responding to one another, but I believe research always has a best answer. It is up to the reader to find the most accurate interpretation of a study, and that means not basing her interpretation solely on herself or the single research she read. To answer your question specifically, I have two suggestions on how readers can reconcile their interpretation with the researchers&#8217; below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reading different studies: Similar studies that produce contradicting results or similar findings help consumers of research reports find credible and accurate findings. Considering different results helps readers find a more well-rounded understanding of the study results, and similar findings confirm the accuracy of the researchers&#8217; findings.</li>
<li>Understanding the research and data analysis process: Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015) state, &#8220;A reader of research [&#8230;] need[s] to understand both the process researchers use to analyze qualitative data and how the results of this process are reported to fully appreciate and evaluate the findings presented in a qualitative research report&#8221; (p. 353). Evaluating the processes the researchers use can help readers find credible processes that will yield reliable results. Basing one&#8217;s judgement on the credibility of the described processes is much more reliable than basing it on the researchers&#8217; or one&#8217;s own interpretations.</li>

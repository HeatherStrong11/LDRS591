<strong>Quality Criteria</strong>

1.The analysis process used rigorous qualitative procedures.

<strong>Rate</strong>

3=Excellent

<strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong>

a) The researchers stated in the study that transcription of the responses were derived from audio recording and a professional transcriber transferred verbal data to written form.

b) Rather than using computerized software that may prohibit the detection of subtle themes, the researchers adopted the strategy of manual coding through key-words-in-text to get a deeper insight to the meaning of words and themes.

c) Given the major concern of separating out personal bias or perceived conclusions, Epoche was applied to address the concern.

d) The researchers used the modified van Kaam method to analyze the data, The seven steps were presented thoroughly and this process led to the findings and themes based on the analyzed data.

e) Although the researchers did not claim clearly, I deemed the list of servant leader quality of Table 1 was the list of the in vivo codes summarized by the researchers.

The researchers analyze and report the interconnections among theme 4, theme 5 and other aspects in the discussion section. But the researchers have not conveyed the relationships among all five themes clearly in the text. However, the themes are interconnected and consistent with the overall case study research design.

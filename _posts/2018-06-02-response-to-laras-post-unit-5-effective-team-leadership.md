<h2><strong>Response to Lara’s post-Unit 5- Effective team leadership</strong></h2>
<p><u>https://create.twu.ca/awalkinthewoods/unit-5-team-leadership/#builder_active </u></p>
<p><em>What have you as a group member (not necessarily the appointed leader) found to be the most challenging aspect of teamwork? What strategies did you find most helpful in dealing with those issues?</em></p>
<p>Conflict can be healthy for a team when it is channeled properly. The challenge for leaders or team members is knowing how and when to intervene. Generational differences or any differences at the workplace may cause conflict, different opinion different understanding, however, <em>diagnosing</em> the situation by<em> listening</em> and <em>discussion</em> to understand how to intervene would be the key to resolve the issue. Being open mind and consider other perceptions will help the situation.<br />
Leaders or team members who understand what each team member seeks; therefore, this approach will help them to create structures that can move things when conflicts arise.</p>
<p><em>Listening</em> and <em>understanding</em> are the tools I use when resolving any conflict, and the following steps are the way I process when conflict arises<br />
-Try to find what are the areas of disagreement<br />
-Try to understand what led to the problem<br />
-Use “<em>discussion</em>” as a tool to understand<br />
-Try to find the root cause<br />
-Seeing the positive viewpoint in each to find the workable solution<br />
Keep in mind, a healthy relationship between the team members will benefit the situation.</p>

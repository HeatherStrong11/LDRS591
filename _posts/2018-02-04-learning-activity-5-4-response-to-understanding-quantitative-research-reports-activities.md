<h3>Response to Understanding Quantitative Research Reports Activities</h3>
<p>I find that when I read scholarly research reports and look through the methodology the first factor that influences my opinion is the sample group, and the definition of the method for data collection. While the statistical analysis of the accuracy of their work is beneficial, I find that even with tools to find mean, standard deviation, z-scores, etc there are huge variables that could affect the outcome from the start solely based on who the researcher choses to question. The characteristics of the sample group can greatly skew the results in many surveys, polls, experiments, etc. Even on such sites as <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/methods/">Pew Research Centre</a>, where sample sizes are often in the thousands, the results can still be way off the norm if the sample population is not diverse enough. While sites like Pew take this into account and try and reach as wide an audience as possible, it is often difficult to do this in an educational setting. I was impressed by the sample diversity in age and experience in Cerit&#8217;s research. It showed that his results were coming from a wide range of teachers many of which have very different perspectives on education and servant leadership( Cerit, 2009). The second part of data collection that I often focus on is the tool for data collection. In this case Cerit used a questionnaire with 65 questions about the topic. I am more drawn to experimental type research methods rather than correlation research, as I find when there is a control group and participants do not necessarily know the purpose of the research they might be more likely to give honest answers, though I am not sure if this is actually true.  I am sure there are plenty of research articles on the validity of research methods. I am sure that if correlation research was not as accurate, more of the social sciences would be using experimental research methods.</p>
<h4>Question for Discussion:</h4>
<p>Do you think Experimental or Non-experimental research designs are more likely to get honest answers from participants? (See Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015. p. 195-196 for examples)</p>

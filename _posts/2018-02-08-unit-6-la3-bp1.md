Chan, K. W. C, &amp; So, G. B. K. (2017). Cultivating servant leaders in secondary schooling. <em>Servant Leadership: Theory and Practice, 4</em>(1), 12-31. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.sltpjournal.org/uploads/2/6/3/9/26394582/03chan_so_vol_4_issue_1.pdf">http://www.sltpjournal.org/uploads/2/6/3/9/26394582/03chan_so_vol_4_issue_1.pdf</a>

<strong>Did the researcher(s) use at least three strategies to validate the findings?</strong>

Chan &amp; Co (2017 p.20) state that they were aiming for &#8220;thematic analysis.&#8221; Transcripts were read and coded independently by two researchers and then discussed, and final coding was agreed. They do this to try and attain inter-rater reliability. Although this one strategy is evidenced. I struggled to find any further information to suggest the use of triangulation, bracketing, or member checking.

<strong>Did the findings include a good description of the people, places, or events in the study?</strong>

Chan &amp; Co (2017) outline their findings using seven critical themes from their codes. Each key topic is then explained further and includes direct quotes from participants, and also a general overview of the task, place, or event that happened related to the theme. Although, it does appear systematic. Having read through it numerous times I have struggled to fully ascertain characteristics of the community-based program curriculum used in the study.

<strong>Did the findings include appropriate themes about the central phenomenon?</strong>

Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015) suggest that to achieve high-quality qualitative research 5-7 themes should be identified. Chan &amp; Co (2017) present seven themes from their coding process; including:

Listening<br />
Empathy<br />
Empathy &amp; Healing<br />
Awareness<br />
Planning, Conceptualization &amp; Foresight<br />
Persuasion<br />
Community Building<br />
(Chan &amp; Co, p. 22).

All seven themes identified can link with servant leadership traits and conclusions are drawn based on this comparison and analysis.

<strong>Did the findings provide a good exploration of the central phenomenon?</strong>

Although undoubtedly Chan &amp; Co (2017) managed to demonstrate links between the outcomes of their community-based secondary school project and servant leadership characteristics. I did find it difficult to understand how this could be replicated elsewhere without an explicit curriculum provided for this course. Based on their two research questions I would argue they answered one adequately, however, there are still gaps in the evidence presented to explain the second effectively.

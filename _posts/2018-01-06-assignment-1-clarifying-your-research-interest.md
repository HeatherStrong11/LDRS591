The six main strands identified in my concept map above consist of Leadership, Education, Family, Politics, Christianity, and Sport. All six topics have had a significant impact on my life at different times and of varying significance. Unsurprisingly to me when creating a concept map with a research focus my two most substantial strands are education and sport. As a physical education teacher, both topics have naturally held my interest since a young age. Some on the map including leadership and politics are new interests to me and hence have not shown as much development yet. The green circles represent the main six strands. The grey rectangular boxes then more specifically describe either a professional or personal interest in the topic. The red dotted line demonstrates some links I thought about when trying to develop my questions.

The three research questions I have identified are below:

1.What impact can models based practice techniques in physical education have on students developing leadership skills?<br />
<strong>2. How can principles of elite sports coaching be implemented as a professional/leadership development tool in modern education?</strong><br />
3. Considerations required for biblical tech integration within 21st-century Christian secondary schools.

I feel at this stage my most robust question is my second. It combines two of my most significant strands in my concept map and is a topic that holds a lot of personal interest. I also feel it is an area of research that is growing. Coaching models and practices are being delivered and implemented across many public and private sector workplaces. I am interested in observing whether research grows around this topic. My second choice would be my third question. Technology integration within schools is a particular passion of mine. I often find myself questioning how this can be done biblically. Technology like many things can be used for a lot of good. However, it can also be used for evil. Developing an understanding of how we give students cutting edge technology while also protecting them within Christian school environments is something I am passionate about.

To efficiently inform my current first choice research question it would be necessary to undertake academic reading across education, sport, and leadership. I believe there is plenty of research on these topic areas. However, I would be interested to gain the opinion of my classmates to help define further and shape any future research topics and or questions and find out which they believe would be the strongest.

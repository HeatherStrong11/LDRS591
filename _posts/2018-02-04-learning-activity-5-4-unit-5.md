<strong>As a consumer of research reports, the most important thing(s) for me in the methods and results section of a high-quality quantitative research report is/ are&#8230;</strong>

Research process it&#8217;s the first significant element to consider, what I meant by that is, research problem, a literature review related to the problem. Specifying a purpose, then choosing a research design that will process all your variables. I believe literature review plays a prescriptive role in making a decision.

A research design is an essential step in the process of conducting research. To make a right decision on what plan; participants, sample size, time of collection are crucial. The intent of the study, the use of manipulation, any specific procedure needed to make a decision. The variables of interest to be studied participate in choosing the statistical technique and instrument to be used. Keep in mind the reliable and valid result engage in interpreting the results that answer your research question.

The use of descriptive statistics to describe the variables as a first step in the process has an essential value to input towards the next level. Inferential statistics make the variables inferred to a population to may make a generalization and answer the research question.

How do you predict if the selected method and statistical technique will pronounce the statistically meaningful answer to your research question?

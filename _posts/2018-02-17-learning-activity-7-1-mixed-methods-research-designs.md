<h3>Mixed Methods Research Designs</h3>
<h4>What is at the heart of the quantitative/qualitative debate?</h4>
<p>The struggle when studying areas like leadership comes down to two problems. The first problem relates to quantitative research. When studying leadership there is too much diversity, too many factors to take into account to create an empirical formula for understanding all the ways that leaders affect our world (Stentz, Plano-Clark, &amp; Matkin, 2012, p. 1174). The second problem relates to qualitative research in that the purpose of studying leadership is to classify leadership aspects (Stentz, Plano-Clark, &amp; Matkin, 2012, p. 1177). Classification of characteristics and creating reproducible results requires some level of experimentation that is not common to qualitative research. The goal of mixed methods research to to take the best of both worlds and help create a general understanding of leadership with specific reproducible traits. I did also appreciate Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell&#8217;s notion that just because mixed methods seems like the answer by taking the best of both worlds, there are times where quantitative or qualitative research independently would be a better solution (2015, p. 385).</p>
<h4>How has mixed methods been seen as a remedy for advancing leadership research?</h4>
<p>Mixed methods research in leadership brings the scientific validity of quantitative research while also noting that culture context plays a large role in the development and implementation of leadership skills (Stentz, Plano-Clark, &amp; Matkin, 2012, p. 1174). Researchers have been realizing during the research process that one form of research can often lead them to the other and that by utilizing both quantitative and qualitative they get a better understanding of the results (Stenz, Plano-Clark, &amp; Matkin, 2012, p.1180).</p>

<h3>Formal Literature Review</h3>

In this assignment you will demonstrate your scholarly inquiry learning by writing a graduate-level literature review. Assignment 5 is focused on the professional interest you have identified and defined in Assignment 1 and extends the work you did in Assignments 2, 3 and 4. Assignment 5 will be your critical analysis and synthesis of the literature, presented in scholarly prose, fully compliant with APA (6th edition) format.

<h5><strong>Title page</strong></h5>

Create a title page including a title, running head, author byline, institutional affiliation, date submitted and page number.

<h5><strong>Abstract</strong></h5>

You will need to create an abstract that provides a key synopsis of the entire paper so that the reader can determine if he/she wishes to read the full paper. An abstract is a concise 250-word (or less), single-paragraph summary. In a minute or less a reader should be able to learn the purpose of the study, the overall research question or objective, a general description of the method or approach, important results, and important conclusions.

<h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>

The introduction of your paper should begin with one paragraph summarizing in general terms your research topic. This information should stand out and capture your reader’s attention. This introductory material should stand below the restated paper title without any further heading that indicates it is an introduction.

In the next few paragraphs it is important to provide your reader with a brief overview of the problem. It is here that you want to begin to set the stage for your research story. You can build the overview by answering these questions in a few paragraphs: What is the problem? Are there any relevant statistics that address your problem? Why is this problem important to address?

On the basis of your personal knowledge, as well as your investigation of the literature, provide a broad context for your topic by addressing what is known about your topic. It is important also to include the definition of any key terms that you will be using throughout your paper. Remember to include appropriate reference citations, and include any reference you cite in your paper in the reference list.

On the basis of your personal knowledge as well as your investigation of the literature, provide a brief discussion of the major issues or gaps that have been identified related to the topic that is being investigated. This addresses the importance or the significance of your study.

To conclude this section, provide a brief statement outlining the purpose of the study and be explicit about the research question you will be addressing. If you wish, you may also include a paragraph about your personal interest in this topic as a researcher.

<h5><strong>Method</strong></h5>

Following your introduction you want to tell your reader how you chose your articles to review. This is essentially re-writing the information that you collected for assignment 3. Here is an example template that you can use:

A review of the literature was conducted to identify scholarly research of XXXX on XXXX. Published articles were identified through searches of electronic databases that were available at the author’s university library. Databases included in this review were: [list specific databases that you searched]. The following key subject words were used to search the databases: XXX, XXX, XXX, XXX, XXX, XXX (include your search terms from assignment #3 here). Boolean “AND” was used to combine the XXX terms with the XXX terms. This search resulted in a total of XX articles.

The articles were then manually screened for relevance and attainability. Searches of bibliographies from relevant articles were also performed. Of the XX articles retrieved, XX articles were relevant to this review.

The articles were either kept or eliminated due to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria included the following components: peer reviewed, published 2007-2017, written in English language, accessible through the university library. The exclusion criteria included the following factors: any study that does not meet the inclusion criteria, and non-English full text studies were excluded even if an English translation of the abstract was provided. XX studies met the inclusion criteria and were used in the review. The XX articles were drawn from a variety of scholarly sources. Table 1 depicts the list of journals included in this review, the number of articles from each journal and the database used to access the journal.

<h5><em>Critical analysis</em></h5>

In the critical analysis section of the paper you want to tell your reader what strategy you used for organizing, abstracting and critically evaluating important information from the articles you found. For example, this section could look something like this:

For each publication, the methodology that was used to critically appraise each article was 1) a 10-item rating scale for evaluating qualitative studies developed by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015), and 2) a 10-item rating scale for evaluating quantitative studies developed by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015). The description for how articles were classified as high quality or low quality is presented in the table below.

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th align="left">Quality Criteria</th>
  <th align="left">Indicators of high quality (+)</th>
  <th align="left">Indicators of low quality (-)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td align="left">For quantitative studies (QNT)</td>
  <td align="left">Clearly focused study, sufficient background provided, well planned, method is appropriate, measures validated, adequate number of participants, data analysis rigorous with adequate statistical methods, findings and limitations are clearly stated.</td>
  <td align="left">Not focused, insufficient background provided, poorly planned, inappropriate method, invalidated measures, inadequate number of participants, data analysis not rigorous, inadequate statistical methods, unclear findings and limitations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">For qualitative studies (QAL)</td>
  <td align="left">Purpose stated clearly, relevant background literature reviewed, design appropriate, identified researcher's theoretical or philosophical perspective, relevant and well described selection of participants and context, procedural rigour in data collection strategies and analysis, evidence of the four components of trustworthiness (credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability) results are comprehensive and well described.</td>
  <td align="left">Vague purpose, insufficient background, few or unsatisfactory descriptions of participants and context, trustworthiness inadequately addressed, lacks description of data collection, data analysis and results.</td>
</tr>

<h5><strong>Results</strong></h5>

In the results section you are now going to organize what you have learned by summarizing the major themes with full reference citations. This is similar to what you had to do for assignment 2. You may wish to denote these major themes with Level One Headings. If you are organizing your literature review along thematic lines, you may want to use Level Two Headings to further organize sub-themes that emerge within the broader themes. Whether you choose to follow a study-by-study or a thematic approach, it is very important that you do not just simply recite a summary of the research report. The purpose of a literature review is to connect research reports to your stated problem through analysis and synthesis. Throughout this process you must critically appraise the relevance and value of the literature.

<h5><strong>Discussion</strong></h5>

In the discussion section you should open by restating the problem you are investigating. You then want to state the major findings and discuss whether or not your literature review supported or did not support your research question. In this section you should describe your own interpretation of the results (e.g., identify gaps, inconsistencies, strengths, weaknesses based on your critical analysis) and link these interpretations back to the literature that was reviewed. You also need to discuss the limitations of your findings and make recommendations (and offer a rationale) for future research on the topic. End this section with a commentary on the importance of your findings and provide any implications that may result from the findings.

<h5><strong>References</strong></h5>

At the very end list your references. Reference lists must start on a new page, and must be formatted according to APA (6th edition) guidelines pertaining to which type of literature is being cited (i.e., book by one author, book with an editor, journal article, blog and so forth).

<strong>Submit a draft of your assignment for peer review to your assigned partner via email.</strong> Please submit the draft at least one week before the due date to allow for feedback and revisions. Your partner will review your assignment and provide you with feedback following the peer review protocol. Submit your assignment, along with the feedback that you received from your partner with a brief rationale for the changes that you made or didn't make. Please submit this assignment using the Assignment 5 drop box on the learning management system.

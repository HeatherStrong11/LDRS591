In response to Joshua Linkletter&#8217; discussion question: Is there a way to combine quantitative and qualitative research studies that would add value to one’s research?

Plano-Clerk &amp; Creswell (2015) stated: “many of today’s research problem calls for both explanation and exploration”(p.381).

Thinking of using a combination of qualitative and quantitative data can improve an evaluation by ensuring that the strengths of another balance the limitations of one type of data. Therefore, providing that understanding enhanced by integrating different ways of knowing. Evaluation of invested both quantitative data (numbers) and qualitative data (text, images) disclose to the importance of planning how these will be combined. I believe its an approach to specific extent solving a problem and answer your research question.

<h3>Clarifying my Research Interests Assignment</h3>

<h5>My first research question is:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Does coding and technology actually benefit student development or is it a &#8220;fad&#8221;?</li>
</ul>

There is a great deal of pedagogical focus on bringing coding into the classroom. Whether it be logical sequencing or actual programming languages, coding is a popular topic in education. As someone who teaches applied skills and technology to students from grades 4 to 7, and someone who is passionate about programming and logic, this subject is very pertinent to me. I often wonder if coding and programming is as integral to the future development of all learners and whether it  actually aids in student development.

<h5>My second research question is:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Can wilderness adventures bring out the best abilities in those with physical or mental difficulties?</li>
</ul>

I am an educator that is passionate about promoting the respectful and honourable treatment of those members of our society viewed to be at a disadvantage, as well as a person passionate about getting out into nature and bringing students into the outdoors. I would be interested to research new and innovative ways to create adaptions for special needs students to participate in outdoor education. It is important that these adaptions do not just meet their needs, but also bring out their strengths and promote an attitude of success and accomplishment.

<h5>My third research question is:</h5>

<ul>
<li>How does outdoor education aid in the development of student lead inquiry?</li>
</ul>

Through wilderness lore, survival training and camping experiences outdoor education can provide students with countless opportunities for adventure. However, do these opportunities really help students develop an inquisitive nature that is able to explore the natural world around them and then adapt their learning to other types of real world situations.

<h5>My strongest topic would be research question 1</h5>

I feel that the most interesting topic for me to research would be the issue of technology in the classroom. There is a fair amount of formal research done on the topic, and I would be able to create appropriate questions for data collection in a survey research design model. There is more quantitative data available on how technology impacts human knowledge, intelligence, attention, etc. As a topic that is so prevalent in current pedagogy it is important for educators to understand whether coding is an effective tool to aid in student development. I expect most of my research for this topic will be done in the fields of education and technology, though psychology will also play a large role. I do not expect to delve into neuroscience, though others more adept in that area could view the topic from a health and neuroscience lens.

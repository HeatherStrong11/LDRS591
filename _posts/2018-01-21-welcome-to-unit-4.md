<p>This week we are going to begin learning about the different sections of research reports and begin exploring the research that has been published on servant leadership.  In unit 4 we will start right at the very beginning – the introduction.  In this unit we will unpack the three common elements in the introduction of a research report including: the research problem, the literature review and the research purpose.  The learning activities this week are geared toward evaluating the elements of an introduction section of a research report, appraising types of research problems for suitability to quantitative or qualitative studies, and examining the origin, development and application of servant leadership.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the learning activities this week, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>

<p>Jenkins, M., &amp; Stewart, A. C. (2010). The importance of a servant leader orientation. <em>Health Care Management Review, 35(1),</em> 46-54.</p>
<p><strong>What sampling strategy was used and was it justified?</strong></p>
<p>A nonprobability sampling strategy was used for this study. Only one healthcare system was used in this study. The article notes this was done out of convenience as this one particular healthcare system was used based on the researcher association and access to data. Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) admit that many quantitative research studies use nonprobability sampling but they state, &#8220;Although convenient, their use limits the conclusions that can be drawn about the results from a study. For example, a researcher who studies nurses at one inner city clinic cannot draw conclusions about nurses in general because the participating nurses at that clinic may be different from typical nurses in some important ways&#8221; (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 236). This quote is particularly relevant to this study as it shows some of the limitations of this sampling strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Is the sample size appropriate and justified?</strong></p>
<p>There were 346 nurses available for the study but only 251 participate in the survey. Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) suggest 350 participants for a survey study but also note that this could vary depending on the size of the overall population. Though adequate, more participants would have enhanced this study.</p>

<p><strong>Are good quality measures used to gather data? How do you know they are good quality?</strong></p>
<p>An attitudinal measure is used to gather participants feelings about their department head and job satisfaction (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015). The study used the 5-point Likert Scale when asking specific questions. The article gives evidence of the reliability of the instruments used.</p>
<p>Rating: 3</p>
<p><strong>Are the data gathered using ethical procedures?</strong></p>
<p>The participants were not required to do the study as part of their job. This is most likely why only 251 of the 346 nurses completed the survey. The study was completely voluntary and confidentiality was ensured. The organization was interested in this study because of its relevance to internal assessment and leadership training. No harm was done to the participants whatsoever.</p>

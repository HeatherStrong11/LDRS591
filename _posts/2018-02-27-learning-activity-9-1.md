<strong>Does the project focus on a real problem in practice?</strong>

Simarjit identifies a very practical and real problem of noise in a shared workspace. Simarjit notes that much of the work done in her clinic requires thinking and paperwork, yet there are often times when patients or colleagues can be heard talking close by. It is clear this problem arose from Simarjit&#8217;s own experience.

Rating: 3

<strong>Does the researcher plan to study his or her own practices or plan to collaborate with community members?</strong>

Simarjit planned on interviewing colleagues to get their opinion of the noise, as well as ask them to join the study. She also planned on getting approval from her superiors.

Rating: 3

<strong>Does the project include careful reflection about the problem?</strong>

It is clear that the project included careful reflection as Simarjit first sought to gather information and research the issue before making conclusions. In fact, Simarjit reflects on the problem throughout her podcast by noting that the noise has been an issue for her and that it may also be an issue for others in the clinic.

<strong>Does the researcher plan to gather several sources of information (e.g., qualitative and quantitative procedures)?</strong>

Simarjit planned on gathering qualitative data by interviewing, asking questions and gathering information from colleagues. However, she notes earlier in her podcast that researching how noise affects the workplace would be included in this. Though qualitative data collection would most likely be the most helpful for this project, there could be quantitative data that would help address the problem.

<strong>Does the researcher develop a clear plan for addressing the problem?</strong>

There is a clear plan to address this problem. Simarjit notes her limitations in data analysis and notes that she would need help to do that. She lays out a clear plan that involves her colleagues, research and discussion groups. It was very well thought out.

Rating: 3

<strong>Does the project include reflecting, thinking, looking, and gathering information and acting?</strong>

The project has a clear flow and includes all of the above actions, as well as a plan to follow up on the study if it were to be taken up. Strategies for cutting down the noise are given and the possibility of an entirely different solution is acknowledged based on the results of the research. Simarjit makes clear the action taken would follow the results.

<strong>Will the results of the project enhance the lives of those involved?</strong>

The problem being addressed is quite practical and is something we can all imagine in our own workplace. The resultsÂ  will enhance the environment for all those involved in the clinic by helping them work more efficiently without distraction.

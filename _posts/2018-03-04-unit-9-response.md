This is a response to Simarjit Shergill&#8217;s post <a href="https://create.twu.ca/icandothis/2018/03/01/ldrs-591-activiy-9-3/">https://create.twu.ca/icandothis/2018/03/01/ldrs-591-activiy-9-3/</a>

Question: Where do you think the results should be discussed in detail? In the results section itself, or in discussion?

I totally agree with Simarjit that the results should be discussed in detail in the results section. It is said clearly in the textbook that &#8220;Drawing conclusions involves the researcher making interpretations about the results and evaluating the procedures and results that occurred in the study&#8221; (Plano &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 465). In another word, the conclusion part is mainly about two kinds of information: interpretations and evaluations.

I noticed that Simarjit also mentioned the Discussion section should only focus on the conclusions, authors’ interpretation of results, and the other elements. I could partly agree with this opinion. I do not think the discussion section of all studies should only focus on the seven elements and cannot provide any detailed results. If the researchers need to go back to the detailed results to interpret or evaluate the results in the Discussion section, they can state the necessary results one more time to help the reader better understand the interpretations about the results. Therefore, I suggest that the Discussion section should mainly focus on the conclusions, authors’ interpretation of results, and the other elements.

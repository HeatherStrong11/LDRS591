<p>I would like to restate my original decision that I posted in unit 1.Â I am one of the mentors in the company and my job is to regularly pass the knowledge and skills required in the work to all the new staff and part of the old staff. Last year, I decided to change their course arrangement to make the timetable perfect for everyone.</p>
<p>Most of the old staff resisted this change at first for thinking that their arrangement for personal time would be changed as well. Therefore, I made a survey and did the research to find out the available time for everyone. I also adjusted the arrangement of different courses to make sure everyone was on the right course and right time. At last, the new timetable was implemented.</p>
<p>After taking this class, based on what I have gained for the last two month, I think I should not have just technically found out their available time through the survey. It would be better for me to consider my decision from other perspectives and then make up my mind. First, I could look for some documents and literature to see if there is a better way to rearrange the course or another way to help the staff. In addition, I could ask my manager to obtain his opinion, talk to my colleagues (the other mentors) to see their perspectives, and &#8220;interview&#8221; some staff to find out the reasons why they would accept the new timetable or refuse to accept. Furthermore, I would like to make the implementation a spiral process. If there were anything unsuitable during the implementation, I would go back to the problem or the other parts to reconsider and adjust the process. All these procedures and critical thinking above would make the decision more comprehensive and mature.</p>
<p>The most important thing I gained from this course is critical thinking. I have realized that critical thinking should be applied to not only reviewing articles but also decision making and other issues in work and life.</p>

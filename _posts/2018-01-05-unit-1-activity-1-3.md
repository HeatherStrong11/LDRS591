<p>How did the authors of the articles conceptualize evidence-based leadership?</p>
<p>The significance of “best practices” and “lessons learned” is emphasized in the article of Patton (2001). Although he prefers to use “better practices” instead of “best practices”, “best practices” are still the most popular form of knowledge and act as the principles to guide practice. On the other hand, the number of supporting evidence and supporting sources determines whether a “lesson learned” is meaningful. Clearly, the more rigorous and the greater number of the evidence, the more confidence one has in the lessons learned.</p>
<p>Moreover, Trybus (2007) states that WWC established by the US Department of Education’s Institute of Education Sciences will transform education into an evidence-based field with standards of scientifically based research. She also mentions that a sound decision making needs the equilibrium of application and utilization of evidence-based research and professional wisdom.</p>
<p>Walshe and Rundall (2001) formally introduce the concept of evidence-based practice. Firstly, the authors illustrate how evidence-based practice is applied to health care. The gap between research and clinical practice in health care generated three problems, whereas evidence-based practice has greatly improved this situation. Then, the evidence-based practice is used in the managerial domain. In order to make the best use of the evidence-based practice, the managerial culture and the preference of qualitative research of managers should both be taken into account. Also, the differences between managers and clinicians of making decisions offer another perspective on the implementation of evidence-based practice. At last, the authors combine all the aspects mentioned above and depict evidence-based leadership as leaders who are more able and willing to use evidence in the decision-making process, also can deal with the complexities of the practice, and make an improvement in the quality of management.</p>
<p>What is considered as “evidence”?</p>
<p>There are many understandings and notions of “evidence”.  Walshe and Rundall (2001) articulate in the essay that “evidence” should include the guidelines being produced and disseminated, the training in techniques such as critical appraisal, and the books and journal papers about evidence-based practice. Also, the “evidence” means the culture, research base, and decision-making processes.</p>
<p>I think there are another two aspects should be considered as “evidence” after reading and reflecting all the articles. They are rigorous and well-conducted research findings in suitable context, and the real things happened in the history.</p>
<p>Why is evidence-based decision-making important?</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, the decision made through evidence-based practice is more sound than other decisions. Secondly, the evidence-based practice in decision-making offers a logical way to make the decision sensible. At last, an evidence-based decision gives persuasive arguments for other people to accept and be supportive.</p>
<p>My question</p>
<p>Everyone has different opinions of “evidence”. Clearly, we would only use the ones that sound reliable to us. What kinds of evidence would you use in your decision-making process?</p>

<p>that the results be summarized and present in a succinct manner. I personally do not like long conclusions, I prefer them to be brief and easy to understand, without a heavy reliance on statistical references. The results should also be organized and discussed in a logical manner. I also like to see how the authors related the results to previous studies, and to their hypothesis/hypotheses. Oftentimes there will be a long drawn discussion without a clear mention of whether the study supports or refutes their hypothesis. The scope and applicability of the results must also be discussed in conclusions. This gives the reader a clearer idea of the implications of the results of the study in their practice. As part of the back notes, in addition to references, an important component are the appendices. I like to see that the authors attached their tools, survey questionnaires etc. to help the readers understand their process/methods, and their interpretation.</p>
<p>Question:  Where do you think the results should be discussed in detail? In the results section itself, or in discussion ? I personally prefer the results to be discussed in the results section, and the discussion section to only focus on the conclusions, authors&#8217; interpretation of results, and the other elements mentioned above.</p>

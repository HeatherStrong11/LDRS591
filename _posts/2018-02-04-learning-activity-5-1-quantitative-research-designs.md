<h3>Quantitative Research Designs</h3>

<h4>What quantitative research design is used and is it justified?</h4>

A correlational research design (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015. p 204) is used in Cerit&#8217;s article on the effects of servant leadership behaviours of school principals (2009). Cerit is using this method to survey a variety of teachers opinions of their principal and if a principal demonstrates servant leadership, how that affects their (the teacher&#8217;s) job satisfaction. The correlational research design provides the opportunity to survey a wide range of participants without manipulating their response to get a variety of responses and use statistical procedures to analyze the results (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015. p 204-205). This research method is helpful in that it surveys a wide range of perspectives on the same problem and can ignore outliers that may alter the data based on unrelated variables.

<h4>Are good quantitative procedures used to select and assign participants?</h4>

Cerit surveyed a wide range of teachers and out of a possible 700 participants at 29 elementary schools in Turkey, 595 teachers responded. They are of various levels of experience, age, and gender. Cerit&#8217;s sample was very diverse (2009. p. 608).

<h4>Are good quantitative data collection procedures used?</h4>

The procedures for the participants seems appropriate for the design model. Cerit (2009) uses the 68 question survey based on the servant leadership scale (OLA) developed by Laub (Cerit, 2009. p. 608). Teachers’ job satisfaction was measured using Mohrman–Cooke–Mohrman (1977) job satisfaction questionnaire using a five point Likert scale (Cerit, 2009. p 609).The data was then analyzed in relation to the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) and Barlett Sphericity test to see if Turkish culture may have skewed the results (Cerit, 2009. p. 608-609). It was found to be well within normal results.

<h4>Does the quantitative research design address the study’s purpose?</h4>

Yes, the quantitative research design addresses the study&#8217;s purpose in that it provides a teacher&#8217;s perspective of how much servant leadership influences their job satisfaction. However, using a more formal scientific method such as true experiment or quasi experiment might have resulted in more honest and realistic answers. Sometimes it is important that the participant not know the purpose of the study to have a truly unbiased response. When rating a superior participants natural response might be to rate them with bias, or the notion of job preservation might influence their choices. However, from my past research, it appears that most of the research being done in the field of education is through a survey/questionnaire based correlation research design model, so it must be valid.

18/21 on the Rating Scale for Evaluating the Research Design in a Quantitative Research Report.

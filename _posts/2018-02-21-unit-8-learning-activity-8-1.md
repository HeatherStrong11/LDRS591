I am working in a branch company of State Grid in China. The State Grid is a state-owned electric utility monopoly of China, the largest utility company in the world, and on the Global 500 List (“State Grid”). According to the profession and the nature of the vocation in this company, I have located three distinctly practical problems.

First one: Since the vocation requires a lot of going out errands, the female workers are basically unable to accomplish the principal work especially after giving birth to the child. Not to mention the tacit complaint from the male workers, the female workers are struggling with job worries and would feel insecure and useless. Particularly, some of us are with adults anxiety.

Second one: Because the nature of the job is mainly associated with the safety of <span class="def">high voltage </span>electricity, the company holds plenty of examinations about the content of the electrical safety every year to raise the sense of safety consciousness. The examinations seem to be acceptable for the new and young employers, but the senior workers (especially from 40 to 50) find them irritating and resist to take them. They think they are too old to remember all the content. They also deem that they have been working for more than 20 years, so there is no need for them to take the exams to be aware of the safety issues.

Third one: The labour discipline has been a great issue in this company for many years. Most of the male workers would go back home earlier if they just finish their work of going out errands and return back. They are allowed to go back earlier before the closing time because they might be out for a few days and want to go back home to have a shower or meet their families as soon as possible. While, the other staff, who are not going out in that day, think they can go home earlier randomly as well. It is a very bad influence, and the labour discipline is hard to manage.

This week I have prepared an audio welcome message to introduce you mixed methods research.  You can listen to my audio message here:

You can find the video link I talk about in my audio message <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5e7kVzMIfs">here</a>.

Have a great week!

Dr. Strong

<strong>Reminder:</strong> in week 8 you will need to create your own audio recording to share your action research idea with your colleagues.  Make sure you take some time to practice what you are going to say (I highly recommend creating a script) and give yourself lots of time to record, make mistakes, re-record, make more mistakes, take a break, re-record and then post it on your blog.  Have fun!

<h3>Evidence Based Leadership</h3>

<h5>How did the authors of the articles conceptualize evidence-based leadership?</h5>

Patton discusses the difficulty with generalizing information to find a Best Practice(Patton, 2001. p.331). He shows how context and diversity create a variety of possible outcomes and that when using evidence to create a &#8220;lesson learned&#8221; we must take these into account. Instead of just generating findings about programs we must generate knowledge(Patton, 2001. p.332). These &#8220;high quality lessons learned&#8221; are the culmination of information gathered through research across a vast spectrum of sources, while utilizing contextualization and adaption to create a working hypotheses that is transferable across the profession. (Patton, 2001. p. 334).

Trybus works through the struggle of the No Child Left Behind policy to use scientifically based research to evaluate new strategies implemented in education. While she sees the great benefit the WWC creating a standard of scientifically based research in the field of education, the challenge will be to find and access educational research that meeds these standards (Trybus, 2007. p. 7). She understands that practical wisdom and experience are essential in how to integrate research and evidence into real world practice. (Trybus, 2007. p.8)

Walsh and Rundall demonstrate the importance of using current research in the field of health care to provide the patient with the best possible treatment. &#8220;The care that health professionals provide should be based as closely as possible on evidence from well conducted research into the effectiveness of healthcare interventions.&#8221; (Walsh and Rundall, 2001. p. 431)

<h5> What is considered as “evidence”?</h5>

Evidence is the answer to a hypothesis mined from data using either a qualitative or quantitative approach to the data (Clark and Creswell, 2015. p57). Evidence must be evaluated based on scientific method for accuracy and reviewed by others to help eliminate bias.

<h5>Why is evidence-based decision-making important?</h5>

Evidence based decision making is important to help create unified solutions that can be adapted to a wide range of problems. Evidence based decision making at its core is problem solving by seeking out as much information on a topic as is readily available, prior to acting, by doing so the hope is that the decision maker would have the best possible outcome.

<h5>Discussion Question</h5>

In what real life situation could research and evidence based decision making help you in your profession?

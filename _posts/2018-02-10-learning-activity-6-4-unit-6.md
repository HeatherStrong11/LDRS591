<strong>As a consumer of research reports, the most important thing(s) for me in the methods and results section of a high-quality qualitative research report is/are .</strong> . .

&nbsp;

In qualitative research, participants are the key to explore the central phenomenon; therefore it&#8217;s essential to identify the participants and the site purposefully to best suit qualitative research. Â Selecting specific strategies to guide the purposeful sampling, and the small number of site and participants to present the complexity of the site and the information provided by participants to help researchers answer the research question (Plano-Clerk &amp; Creswell, 2015, p.330,332,335).

A rigorous research design shows all elements of the study fit together logically and coherently and help consumers understand the study. Understanding the how to critique the study is significant in quantitative and qualitative research. The purpose of choosing the procedures is crucial in qualitative research; hence, it&#8217;s necessary for interaction to answer the research question.

Method of collection informs the consumer and conveys the details of data analysis process, knowing the qualitative data analysis is Inductive, interpretive, simultaneous, and iterative may return to consumer more information to the gap in their exploratory research.

Finally, validating findings to ensure the accuracy and credibility of the findings and triangulation is a sign in a notion of finding evidence to support the theme, therefore, providing a good exploration of the central phenomenon.

&nbsp;

<strong>Question</strong>

Considering saturation point and systematic review, does the limitations in a qualitative research influence the consumer in the way of how they evaluate the research report?

Hi Joshua,

Thank you for your post. A few years ago, I taught at an alternate education program in Coquitlam called Encompass and attendance was a big issue there as well.

Your project focused on a very relevant and real problem in your practice and in a lot of schools and classrooms in general. I think that it is a very useful topic to research and extends beyond your school to many other schools and programs. Your plan to interview and survey students is practical and applicable. My only question would be when you would potentially interview the students? Would it be during class time? If so, how would you interview the students who are always away since they would not be in attendance?

Your reflection on the problem are clear and thorough. You have identified the importance and need for the action research plan. You clearly stated your plan for researching this topic and the information you plan to research for background information as well as potential solutions for this issue.Â You developed a clear plan of using alarm clocks and setting clear expectations to address and hopefully correct this problem among the students.

I believe that your action research plan could help many students in your school. It is important for students to be successful in their school and the first step is physical attendance at school. Regular student attendance also allows classes to proceed at a consistent and steady pace and this allows alleviates teachers&#8217; worries and student stress.

Thank you again for your post!

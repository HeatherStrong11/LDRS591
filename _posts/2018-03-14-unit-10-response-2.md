<p>Layla asked,Â &#8220;When the evidence of the study is distort intentionally, what strategy might you adopt to find the truth?&#8221;</p>
<p>If it is clear that the evidence has been distorted or interpreted incorrectly I would look through the methods section to determine how the evidence was gathered, what methods were used, and whether the evidence was gathered in an ethical manner. If the evidence is simply interpreted in a way that I disagree with, I might simply make my own interpretations and use the study as a reference point. However, if the evidence is gathered inappropriately or with a specific outcome in mind, and it is clear that the researchers were not honest researchers, I am not sure if the study is worth trusting at all. Looking for other studies done on the topic would help clarify whether the research strategy was inappropriate but ultimately it would be hard to take much from a study when its findings were distorted.</p>
<p>There may be times when emailing the researchers to question their methods and data is appropriate but as mentioned, checking to see if they built upon previous research and determining if other researchers came to a similar conclusion would be most helpful.</p>

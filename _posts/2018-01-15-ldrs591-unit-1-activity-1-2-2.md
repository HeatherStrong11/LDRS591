<p>Decision can simply be referred to as the art of making a choice between two or more alternatives, that is taking a stand on a particular issue. Decision making process begin with the identification of a problem, which is a discrepancy between an existing state of affairs and desired state of affairs.</p>
<p>As a leader who most times is faced with the task of choosing a course of action that appropriately address a given situation, such factors as the following shape my decision-making process;</p>
<ol>
<li>Perception/Understanding of the subject matter or situation</li>
<li>Information available to me</li>
<li>Evaluation and analysis</li>
<li>Fairness and objectivity</li>
<li>Society/Environment Sensitivity</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree with the proposition in the course note that one’s worldview influences the type of questions we ask, because like what is written in the resource course note, Humanity is especially interested in three fundamental question; which are, What is real? What is true? And What is good?</p>
<p>How we answer this three fundamental question shows or reveals our perspective or our worldview about things in life. Like it said, a worldview is an interpretive framework through which one make sense of themselves, other people and the world around them (Geisler &amp; Watkins, 2003).  That is, a worldview can be expressed as the fundamental cognitive, affective and evaluative presuppositions a group of people make about the nature of things and which they use to order their lives.</p>
<p>For example, the worldview or perceptions of Africans according to (Madu et al 1996) is that, it is believed that Africans have a tragic sense of life. This means that in Africa there is a firm belief in the existence and operation of power of unforeseen circumstances or unpredictable life events in influencing people’s destiny in the world. In this perspective, human beings have limited agency rather than complete control of what happens to them in the world.</p>
<p>What is the nature of ultimate reality and how does it affect your decision making as a leader?</p>

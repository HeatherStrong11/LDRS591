The article I chose to focus on for this unit is<em> The Effects of Servant Leadership Behaviours of School Principals on Teachers’ Job Satisfaction</em> by Yusuf Cerit.

<ol>
<li>Were descriptive analyses reported?<br />
<strong>Rating: 3/3<br />
</strong>Yes, Cerit (2009) uses descriptive statistics to analyze the data collected (p. 609-610). He (2009) details the different statistical tests and calculations used to statistically analyze the data (p. 608-610). Since the variables were continuous, Cerit (2009) found the mean and standard deviations of the variables (p. 610).</li>
<li>What inferential statistics were used? (e.g., correlations, regression analysis, ANOVA, t-test)<br />
<strong>Rating: 3/3<br />
</strong>Cerit (2009) used Pearson correlations to determine a relationship between servant leadership and teacher job satisfaction (p. 610). He (2009) then confirmed his finding by using multiple regression analysis to find the effects of servant leadership on teacher job satisfaction (p. 610).</li>
<li>What were the results? (What was found?)<br />
<strong>Rating: 3/3<br />
</strong>Based on the analysis of the collected data, Cerit (2009) found that servant leadership subscales were positive and significantly correlated with the intrinsic, extrinsic, and total job satisfaction of teachers (p. 611 &#8211; 612). Regression analysis showed that servant leadership characteristics in principals were strong predictors of teacher job satisfaction (Cerit, 2009, p. 612).</li>
<li>Did the analysis represent a good quantitative process?<br />
<strong>Rating: 3/3<br />
</strong>Yes, while my limited knowledge of statistical testing does now allow me to fully understand the tests that Cerit (2009) used in his study, his explanations of the factors and statistics appear objective and the process was impartial and linear. My mathematical background allows me to understand some of the more basic statistical processes he used and to me, those seem valid and correct (Cerit, 2009, p. 610).</li>

<p>This is my response to <a href="https://create.twu.ca/icandothis/2018/03/04/ldrs-591-activity-10-1/">Simarjit Shergill&#8217;s post on Unit 10&#8217;s Learning Activity</a>.</p>
<p>Hi Simarjit,</p>
<p>I have enjoyed learning alongside you in LDRS 591!</p>
<p>Like you, I work in a large organization where decision making is not only up to me. In fact, oftentimes I am left out of much of the policy decision making at my work. Similar to you as well, I find that the skills I have learned in this course aids me in research and improvements in my own practice. I have found that as a teacher, after receiving my degree in education, it is up to myself to pursue meaningful professional development. Understanding how to discern and decide whether the resources I am using are credible helps me to improve my practice in my classroom. As well, it allows me to share ideas with my colleagues without worrying what I am sharing is unreliable. It makes me feel extra smart too when I am able to contribute to intellectual discussions on educational practices in the office <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f609.png" alt="?" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I hope we are in the same course again soon!</p>

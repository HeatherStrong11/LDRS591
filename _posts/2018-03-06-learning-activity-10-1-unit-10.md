<strong>I want to know, if after taking this class, would you make your decisions differently? What new insights have you learned and how would those insights inform your decision-making process now?</strong>

My decision-making process influenced by many factors. Experience or what I call it “learning lesson” is one of these factors, Knowledge, believes, Cultures, organizational goals, relationships, and shared information. Some of my decisions stemmed from self-confidence about what I learned and repeated every day, which helps me respond quickly to situations. Acknowledge my mistakes and take the necessary steps to correct repair or amend the case. I relate to my emotions or other emotions which also affect and influence my decision. Work style and delegating work participated significantly in my decision-making process in a way that I can think in too many directions.

During LDRS 591, my decision-making and critique approaches to thinking or handling have been craved to learn more about servant leadership orientation. I learned to evaluate scholarly research articles and the method used and how to it benefit the study to answer the research question and It all based on evidence, and what I meant by that decision-making evidence-based. I learned it through all units, how to apply these lessons wisely.

APA style was something new to me and useful tool to use since its required in most of the reviews. Also, it was insightful to learn about action research plan, since I can apply these tools at the workplace to suggest some possibilities to resolve problem and support and help others in deciding to solve a problem. Any methods that I learned through quantitative, qualitative, or mixed method can be applied to my leadership skills through my MA lead program and anywhere else.  Hence, they can be part of the action research plan if required. The main idea is to have evidence can support or help resolve an issue. The most important thing is finding an answer coherently to inform my inquiry.

Now I am more aware of credibility, databases, peer reviews, authors names, and some of the front-line journals, the reputation of the author’s work, and academic credential. Sampling and integration of the research add value to the evaluation. Finally, the conflict of interest if it&#8217;s included, and evidence of replication if its available to support the results, which would add value to the study.

<p>b)    The topic is depicted in a broad way.</p>
<p>c)     I found the subject matter appealing because the authors provide two possible explanations for the main topic which pique my interest of keeping reading it.</td>

<td width="198">a)     The authors claim that the existing understanding of servant leadership is not enough.</p>
<p>b)    Two problems are clearly addressed and stated explicitly.</p>
<p>c)     The first problem is about “the need to better understand the scope and magnitude of the influence that servant leadership has on a range of multilevel outcomes and…”</p>
<p>d)    The second problem is the need of more advanced research designs and more comprehensive explorations to help managers better apply servant leadership in the real world.</td>

<td width="198">The authors have identified several deficiencies about the problem:</p>
<p>a)     The results of Walumbwa et al. (2010a) were not clear, therefore, the results need to be extended;</p>
<p>b)    The individual-level outcomes have received little attention by servant leadership scholars, therefore, need to be noticed;</p>
<p>c)     The traits linked to servant leadership and its outcome remain unclear.</p>
<p>d)    There is only one study has linked leader agreeableness to servant leader behaviors; no studies have investigated leader extraversion.</td>

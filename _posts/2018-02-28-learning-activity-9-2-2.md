The article that I will be focusing on for this activity is Barbuto and Gottfredson&#8217;s article <em>An Examination of Emotional Intelligence </em><em>as an Antecedent of Servant Leadership.</em>

<ul>
<li><em>Are the major results identified and summarized?<br />
</em><strong>Rating: 3/3</strong><br />
Yes, Barbuto and Gottfredson (2014) states the correlations that were found between  the leaders’ emotional intelligence and each of the five dimensions of servant leadership (p. 320). The authors clearly state how the results compare to the original hypotheses (Barbuto &amp; Gottfredson, 2014, p. 320).</li>
<li><em>Are the results related to the literature?<br />
</em><strong>Rating: 3/3</strong><em><br />
</em>Barbuto and Gottfredson (2014) mention that all the results support the hypotheses with the exception of one where the results did not support the hypothesis (p. 320). The authors (Barbuto &amp; Gottfredson, 2014) compare their results to their findings in prior research in the discussion portion of the article (p.320).</li>
<li><em>Are appropriate implications of the results for practice identified and justified?<br />
</em><strong>Rating: 2/3<br />
</strong>The authors (Barbuto &amp; Gottfredson, 2014) include a short recommendation in the conclusion section of their article (p. 322). They advise that &#8220;organizations use emotional intelligence, which is a mixture of trait and skill, for leader selection and development if they are seeking to hire leaders who are inclined to lead with a servant-leader ideology&#8221; (p. 322).</li>
<li><em>Is there a thoughtful critique of the study’s limitations?<br />
</em><strong>Rating: 3/3</strong><br />
Yes Barbuto and Gottfredson (2014) include a detailed list of the limitation of this study (p. 322). These include common bias, a lack of signification results in some cases, and the limitations of the sample size (Barbuto &amp; Gottfredson, 2014, p. 322).</li>
<li><em>Are suitable suggestions for future research provided?<br />
</em><strong>Rating: 3/3</strong><br />
Yes, after identifying the limitations of the study, Barbuto and Gottfredson (2014) suggest potential research that could solidify and confirm their findings (p, 322). They suggest that future research increase the followers to leaders ratio and that a similar study be done in the private sector so that the results can be compared to this study (Barbuto &amp; Gottfredson, 2014, p. 322).</li>
</ul>

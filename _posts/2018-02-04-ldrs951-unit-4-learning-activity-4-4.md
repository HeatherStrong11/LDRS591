<p>The following is my review of the purpose statements and research questions in the article titled: Servant leadership: Its origin, development, and application in organizations, by (Sendjaya &amp; Sarros, 2002). The evaluation was performed by applying criteria provided by (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 185).</p>

<h5><strong>Was the study’s purpose clearly specified? </strong></h5>
<p><strong>Rating – 2/3</strong></p>
<p>The authors were very clear in describing the study focus as servant leadership. They were also explicit in defining the overall intent and conceptual framework as being to explore “the philosophical basis of servant leadership as conceptualized by Robert Greenleaf and as represented by historical figures such as Jesus Christ.” (Sendjaya &amp; Sarros, 2002, p. 57). Nonetheless, the description of participants and settings not explicit; although I deduced it as being leaders and followers in an organization, I felt it was too general. In the authors’ defense, one could argue that servant leadership is applicable to any type of organization that has the portfolio of a leader.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h5><strong>Was the focus of the study appropriate?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Rating – 3/3</strong></p>
<p>It can be said that the focus of the study was a single central phenomenon that was worthy of study, considering that at the time of the study, the subject of servant leadership was not already grounded in solid research studies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Was the overall intent of the study appropriate?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Rating – 3/3</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely yes! The authors presented the intent of the study in a very precise manner as being to explore the philosophical basis of servant leadership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Were the participants and sites appropriate?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Rating – 2/3</strong></p>
<p>Although the participants and settings fit into the study’s focus and intent, information about them was too general and was not clearly identified. The authors inferred that the participants were from learning organizations, yet, in the following statement of the study’s purpose, specific information about the participants and settings was not provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h5><strong>Was the purpose of the study narrowed through appropriate research questions and/or hypothesis?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Rating – 2/3</strong></p>
<p>The research questions were built around the authors observation that knowledge gaps were present in the understanding of servant leadership. The authors made use of one hypothesis which could have influenced the study (Bass, 2000). This suggests that the authors were not very open to learning from the participants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Did the purpose of the study follow logically from the statement of the problem and the literature review?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Rating – 2/3</strong></p>
<p>The authors presented the knowledge gaps and significance of the study in a very convincing manner, based upon existing knowledge on the subject of servant leadership. However, information about the participants and settings was not clearly stated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Was the purpose consistent with the study’s overall approach?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Rating – 3/3</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely yes! In addition to being broad and consistent with the researcher’s conceptual framework, I also found that the authors explored individual’s perceptions to provide adequate description of the topic.</p>

As a consumer of research reports, the most important things for me in the methods and results section of a high-quality qualitative research report are (a) <em>participants and data collection</em> (b) <em>data analysis and findings</em>. The following are my reasons;

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>Participants and data collection</strong></h5>

Given that qualitative analysis entails processing a lot of textual or image data, special attention must be given to the quality of the data sources used in a qualitative study. As such, the study participants should be capable of providing rich information that is relevant to the purpose of the study. In addition, data should be gathered using rigorous qualitative process, until the point of saturation is reached.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Data analysis and findings</strong></h5>

I share in the views of Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015, p. 353); research will not be research without the analysis of data. After gathering credible data, the data must be analysed rigorously in order to gain valuable findings that could contribute towards answering the research questions, achieving the study intent, and much more. Finally, it is also important that the findings are validated in order to eliminate possible researcher’s bias and more.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>Question:</strong></h5>

It is apparent that the researcher would spend tremendous time and resources with data analysis and findings in a qualitative study. Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015, p. 358) suggests that data analysis in a qualitative study is very difficult especially as “qualitative computer programs do not analyse the data for researchers.”

From the above statement, data analysis in a qualitative study is mostly done manually. My question is: do we now have computer software that can analyse data for a qualitative study, considering that Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell’s suggestions were made in 2015?

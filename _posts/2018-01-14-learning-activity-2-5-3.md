<p>For my research, I plan on starting off slow and working my way up to the more complex material. First, I will probably engage in some useful conversations with my colleagues and teachers on campus. This will help give me a general idea of what sources I should be looking for and what direction I want to take my research in. While these aren’t considered scholarly resources I feel it is important to start of research with general conversation to get the mental possibilities churning!</p>
<p>Next, I will probably read a few books and journal articles to heighten my overall awareness and knowledge. This would include the peer-reviewed article and book I wrote about in my previous posts as well as what experts in the field have to say on the subject. At this stage, I would also have a research journal and write down everything I find interesting or of potential value to my paper and include where it was from so that I could reference it properly later.</p>
<p>Lastly, I would go deeper and more specific with my research. I would look for studies that were done that revolved mature historical content in schools. For instance, I’m wondering right now whether or not child brain development can tell whether or not someone is ready for mature content and possibly to what extent. After all, students grow at different paces all around. At this point, my research may take me to other areas including child psychology, children’s literature, or perhaps even reconciliation projects. </p>
<p>Although I’m pretty good at telling if a site it a credible and reliable source, if I’m ever in doubt I can always refer to the list that was given to us on the course site (https://create.twu.ca/ldrs591-sp18/unit-2-notes/). I find this is a thorough and trustworthy method of figuring out what is worth putting into professional work.</p>

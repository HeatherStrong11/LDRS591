<p>As a consumer of research reports, the most important things for me in the introduction section of a high-quality research report are a clearly stated purpose and a concise summary of background information and prior knowledge on the topic. In general, I only read research reports when I am working on my own research paper or project. As such, I am reading through numerous reports in order gain information and knowledge on my topic of interest. Since I am reading a large number of articles, I need to be able to quickly read the introduction of a report and screen whether it is what I need for my research.</p>
<p>Aside from the abstract, the introduction is what I read quickly to determine if the article is useful for my research. The purpose of the article must be stated clearly so that I can immediately decide whether I will continue to read the article because it aligns with my research, or whether it investigates another area of the topic that is not helpful for me.</p>
<p>Adequate background information and discussion of prior knowledge is also important in the introduction. First, it allows me to better understand the purpose and methods that the researchers will use in their study. Second, I am able to have a general idea of the validity of the article based on the sources that it cites for their information. If the article cites reliable sources, I have more faith in the validity of the article and the quality of the research.</p>
<p><em>Is it possible to have a good research paper without a good introduction? Does a bad introduction always mean a poorly written or researched paper? </em></p>

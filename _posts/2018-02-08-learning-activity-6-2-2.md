<p>Jones, D. (2012). DOES SERVANT LEADERSHIP LEAD TO GREATER CUSTOMER FOCUS AND EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION?. <i>Business Studies Journal</i>, <i>4</i>(2), 21-35.</p>
<p><strong>What sampling strategy is used and is it appropriate and justified?</strong></p>
<p>The researchers used snowball sampling in the study. In this case it was justified as the researchers were looking for a very specific group of people. Participants were asked to provide referrals to other people who were in higher positions of leadership in a business setting and who also practiced servant leadership. Many of the participants were unknown to the researchers before beginning the study.</p>

<p><strong>Is the sample size appropriate?</strong></p>
<p>According to Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) the sample size was appropriate. They say a sample size between 20 to 30 is appropriate for a grounded theory study (Plano &amp; Clark, 2015, p. 336). The study had 21 participants.</p>

<p><strong>Is the data collected appropriately?</strong></p>
<p>The study used one-on-one interviews to conduct their data. The interviews ranged from one to two hours in length. The interviews were recorded and then analyzed and coded at a later time. Given that the participants were leaders who were comfortable to share in an interview style setting, this method was suitable for the study. It also allowed participants to develop and share their thoughts freely rather that following a rigid structure.</p>

<p><strong>Are the data gathered ethically and thoughtfully?</strong></p>
<p>It would seem as though the researchers gathered their data ethically and thoughtfully but nothing is specifically said about it. There is no mention of the participants anonymity or specific ethical practices. There is mention of thoughtful questions asked and permission is implied, yet very little is specifically said in about ethical conduct or practices.</p>

<strong>Direct quote less than 40 words with proper in-text citation:</strong>

McLeskey et al (2012) explain, “CES developed and implemented a highly effective and inclusive program with little outside assistance, and no additional resources other than those that are typically available to local schools.” (p. 68)

<strong>Direct quote more than 40 words with proper in-text citation:</strong>

The criteria used to select the participating elementary school:

A setting in which students with disabilities were included in general education classrooms at a level that was well above the local district and state averages, and achievement levels for students with disabilities and those who struggle in core content areas (reading and mathematics) that were well above district and state averages. (McLeskey et al., 2012, p. 60)

<strong>Paraphrased with proper in-text citation:</strong>

The authors identified six themes through investigation that fall into two overarching categories: (a) Student Support and Instructional Quality and (b) Administrative and Organizational Features. The six themes found through the study were: (1) meeting the needs of all students, (2) delivering high-quality instruction, (3) immersing teachers in professional development, (4) flexible and efficient use of resources, (5) shared decision making, and (6) using data to drive everything. Themes 1 – 3 cover Student support and instructional quality, and 4 – 6 administrative and organizational features. (McLeskey et al., 2012, p. 62 &#8211; 68)

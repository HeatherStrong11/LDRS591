As we go along with the meaning and finding of “worldview,” I think It depends on the way from where you see it. Is it your believes or others. And if I have to think about others, I should include other factors like childhood, behaviors, cultures, relationships, and community It&#8217;s not limited to assumptions, but also contains principles. So I believe it’s a cogent engagement between the premises and the policies that we regarded to; therefore it&#8217;s unlimited.

Let&#8217;s think about it this way; if I have to draw a letter E on my forehead for you to see it, what do you think it will look alike, Either way, E or e. It will be, either way, The way I can see it as E or the way you can see it as E.

I do agree with the proposition made by the authors that one&#8217;s &#8220;worldview,&#8221; influence the type of question you asked and the process that you use to find the answer to your question.

My decision-making process influenced by many factors. Experience or what I call it &#8220;learning lesson&#8221; is one of these factors, Knowledge, believes, Cultures, Organizational Goals, relationships, and shared information. Some of my decisions stemmed from self-confidence about what I learned and repeated every day, which helps me respond quickly to situations. Acknowledge my mistakes and take the necessary steps to correct repair or amend the case. I relate to my emotions or others emotions which also affect and influence my decision. Work style and delegating work participated significantly in my decision-making process in a way that I can think in too many directions.

In the sense of what I mentioned, my next question will be How to resolve conflict?

This week in the learning activities you are asked to review an article and then make some adjustments to your original review based on APA style formatting requirements.  I understand that there may be some challenges with formatting a blog post in Word Press to conform to APA style rules, so I am going to provide you with three options for submitting your learning activities this week:

<ol>
<li>You can submit the unit 3 learning activities as a word document in the Unit 3 learning activities drop box on Moodle.</li>
<li>You can send the word document to me as an attachment directly via email.</li>
<li>You can upload a PDF of your document to your blog and insert it in a blog post like I have done below with the example APA title page.  Thank you Rob for the suggestion!!</li>
</ol>

Here is how you add a PDF file link to your blog:

Click on &#8216;Add media&#8217; tab above the text box.  Select the &#8216;upload files&#8217; tab.  Then chose the file you want to upload and then select &#8220;insert into post&#8221;

Let me know if you have any other questions!

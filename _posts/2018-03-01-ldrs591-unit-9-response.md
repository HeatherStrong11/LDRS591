This is a response to <a href="https://create.twu.ca/icandothis/2018/03/01/ldrs-591-activiy-9-3/">Simarjit&#8217;s post</a>.

Hello Simarjit,

You proposed the question: Where do you think the results should be discussed in detail? In the results section itself, or in discussion? This is a question I have considered in the past as I always find it interesting to observe how the researchers decide to visually present their data, to what depth they present their data, and where they present their interpretations of the results. To my understanding, the two sections &#8211; results and discussion &#8211; play different roles in a study. The results should be the presentation of the findings. It should contain a logical, complete, and readable presentation of the data they collected in reference to their research question. The discussion section in comparison should be the researchers&#8217; interpretation based on the empirical data they collected and highlight the key findings in relation to answering its key question(s). Both of these sections require a detailed information as they present different information that are crucial to understanding the key themes grounded in the data collected.

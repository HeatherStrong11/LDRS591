I have finally made my way through all of the unit 3 learning activities for the 12 learners in the class (6 activities x 12 learners = 72 assignments to grade over a weekend &#8211; yikes!) Here I will provide some general comments in response to some of things I noticed as I worked through the learning activities this weekend.

When you are preparing your assignments in the future please consider the following:

<ol>
<li>Take a few minutes to carefully investigate what is required for an APA style title page. Here is an example of what an APA title page should look like.  Take some time to compare your 3.6 learning activity to this one and see if you can spot the differences.  <a href="http://create.twu.ca/drheatherstrong/files/2018/01/Example-APA-Title-Page-1.pdf">Example-APA-Title-Page</a>.  There is also an example of an APA style title page on page 41 in the APA manual and on page 229 (at the bottom) there are specific instructions about what should be included on your title page.  Your title page should include 1) a running head 2) a page number 3) a title 4) author byline 5) and institutional affiliation.  For future assignments it would also be good to include the date that your assignment was submitted on the title page as well.</li>
<li>Many of you had challenges with the running head.  Please read the APA blog post below if you are struggling with what this should look like and why you need to include it <a href="http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2012/05/mysteries-of-the-running-head-explained.html">http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2012/05/mysteries-of-the-running-head-explained.html</a></li>
<li>I found I was making several comments about punctuation around quotation marks.  Here is another helpful APA blog about this very issue.  Please refer to this blog post for further information <a href="http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2011/08/punctuating-around-quotation-marks.html">http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2011/08/punctuating-around-quotation-marks.html</a></li>
<li>Now that you have worked through the APA manual it is imperative that moving forward that you give credit to your sources!  “Whether paraphrasing, quoting an author directly, or describing an idea that influenced your work, you must credit the source” (APA, 2010, p. 170).  Here is a helpful article from Purdue OWL Writing Center on this very topic: <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/589/02/">https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/589/02/</a></li>
</ol>

This was a hard unit to get through, but you have all done very well!  I said this in my email to all of you, but the time and energy you have put into these assignments now will help build your awareness of APA style through out the rest of this course and the rest of the program.

If you have any other questions about APA style, please do not hesitate to ask!  I am here to help you navigate through the deep APA waters!

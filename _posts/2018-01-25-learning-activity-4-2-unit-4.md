<h1><strong>Learning activity 4.2</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is the topic interesting?</strong><br />
The topic has the attractive part apply when servant leaders inspire servant followers, therefore the positive impact on employees’ outcomes, climate service, and organization. I found it pertinent and engaging in my research interest related to leadership study.</p>
<p>Rated 3</p>
<p><strong>Is there a meaningful problem?</strong><br />
In this study, a need to understand better the influence of servant leadership has on a range of multilevel outcomes, and the differential influences of leadership conceptualized at the individual and group level. On the other hand, more advanced research design and comprehensive exploration that will benefit scholars and managers to understand better how to apply servant leadership best and what benefits can be expected. To a certain extent, the study addresses two problems that need to be solved, and they explicitly stated.</p>
<p>Rated 3</p>
<p><strong>Is the importance of the problem justified?</strong><br />
The study provided the necessity to advance understanding particularly servant leadership and provided clear evidence of the importance of the problem through reviewing literature that supports understanding leadership in general, and particularly servant leadership. They refer to Liden et al. (2008) &amp; Walumbawa et al.(2010a).</p>
<p>Rated 3</p>
<p><strong>Are there deficiencies in the knowledge about the problem?</strong><br />
To a certain extent, as a result, Liden et al. (2008), only one individual-level servant leadership emerged as a significant predictor. More extensive multi-level model of servant leadership found in Wlaumbawa et al. (2010a), However, it wasn’t answering the scholarly inquiry about social influence framework. So they expand upon their findings. Only one study linked to leader agreeableness to servant leader behaviors and no study has investigated leader extroversion which they are the core value of this stud.</p>
<p>Rated 3</p>
<p><strong>Is an audience identified and are there specific examples of how the audience can use the missing knowledge?</strong></p>
<p>It was apparently noted the study would benefit scholar and managers better understand how to apply servant leadership best and what the benefit expected from this emphasis. Its posted in Leadership Quarterly, which I believe will have an interest in all leadership forms.</p>
<p>Rated 2</p>
<p><strong>Does the passage clearly argue that the study is warranted?</strong><br />
The topic, problem, justification, deficiencies, and audiences form logical, coherent, and convincing argument that the study is of interest, significant, and needed. It proposed that “Servant leaders initiate the cycle of service, influencing a range of multi-level outcomes through climate service.”</p>
<p>Rated 3</p>
<p><strong>Is the passage well written?</strong><br />
To a certain extent, the passage was engaging, concise, and easy to follow.</p>

Dear Dr. Strong,

It’s me! I am the super quiet. I am a hardworking student who tried to do the best due diligence work to read and learn through the units and do assignments on time and sometimes, they are not on time. Thank you for all chances that we have, and your time that you gave me and everyone to support our needs in this learning process. Thank you for your time grading our assignments. Thank you for seeing the best of all your students. Thank you for allowing me and all of us to have our voices heard especially in unit eight, It was an excellent opportunity to learn how to take action to correct the problem professionally. Dr. Strong, you extracted every great thought that we have learned, It’s appreciated to know someone genuinely cares about our understanding process.<br />
I will go forward and be better learner and listener because of the lessons I learned from LDRS 591-OL.

Sincerely,

Wafa Siyam/ MA lead program/2018

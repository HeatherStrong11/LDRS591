I have chosen a journal article by Ambrish (2014). The title is: “Entrepreneurship Development: An approach to Economic Empowerment of Women.” It can be found here:

http://ezproxy.student.twu.ca:2152/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&#038;sid=9307389a-5c2d-48de-91b1-e7950a4a44bc%40sessionmgr4009

&nbsp;

The following, is my summary of the article;

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>

The article identified several problems that affect women entrepreneurs in India and their socio-economic fortunes. It described the involvement of selected Indian government institutions in women entrepreneurship, and what could be done to use entrepreneurship development as a tool for empowering women economically.

&nbsp;

There was no research hypothesis in the article.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>Methods</strong></h5>

The author made use of secondary data obtained from published reports of journals, websites and publications from credible government institutions in India. A qualitative study design was used in the research. There were no experimental manipulations mentioned by the author, also, the author did not make reference to any specific research problem.

<h5></h5>

<h5><strong>Results/Findings</strong></h5>

The author described how trends in India indicate an increase in the number of women embracing entrepreneurs.  This notwithstanding, the author also mentioned several problems which, if not addressed, could potentially reduce the growing number of women entrepreneurs in India. Some of these problems include: the lack of entrepreneurial skillsets, discrimination, and other socio-cultural factors which create obstacles for prospective women entrepreneurs.

&nbsp;

Several measures that could help reduce the problems were described by the author. Such measures include; securing the involvement and support of government agencies and International organizations like the World Bank, with the design of programmes that could bring about positive attitudinal changes towards women and women entrepreneurs. Such programmes should help more women realise their unique identity and the importance of their role in economic growth.

Other measures described were; re-designing the school curriculum to ensure that women are deliberately taught or exposed to entrepreneurship from their childhood, exposing more women to structured trainings that will develop their entrepreneurial skills, exposing more women to information technology, and the involvement of already established women entrepreneurs and women development corporations with grooming and developing more women along the lines of entrepreneurship.

In my opinion, the results/findings of the author were quite relevant but not extraordinary.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>Conclusions</strong></h5>

Conclusions were based on the following quote from Jawaharlal Nehru, “you can tell the condition of a nation by looking at the status of its women.” Based on this, the author emphasized the need for an attitudinal change towards women in general and also women entrepreneurs. An attitudinal change would aid the development of an enabling environment for women to unleash their entrepreneurial talents. The ultimate objective being that an increase in women entrepreneurs would have positive implications for the future economic prosperity of their society.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>Personal comments</strong></h5>

I found the article informative in providing guidance on how more women could be empowered by encouraging them to embrace entrepreneurship as a means for enhancing their socio-economic fortunes. Although the author was biased towards women in India, the discussion and suggestions are also relevant to women in most of the developing countries.

The study relates to my research topic because it provides general information about one of the existing methods for empowering women. Through the study, I am also able to contemplate on the limitation of entrepreneurship in empowering women. This, I believe, could help me in contemplating other alternatives to entrepreneurship.

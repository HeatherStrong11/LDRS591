<p>This is in response to Layla&#8217;s post on worldview- https://create.twu.ca/layla11/2018/01/04/unit-1-activity-1-2/</p>

<p>I really like the way she has consolidated the the five principal factors that she thinks influence one&#8217;s decision making. Having said this, I will move straight to her question, &#8220;<span style="float: none;background-color: transparent;color: #333333;font-family: 'Libre Franklin','Helvetica Neue',helvetica,arial,sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: 400;letter-spacing: normal;text-align: left;text-decoration: none;text-indent: 0px">How to reconcile opinions of different worldviews to reach an agreement when there is a conflict?</span>&#8221; This somehow echoes my question about how does one reconcile their worldview with someone else&#8217;s or company policy, if they happen to differ? If we think of worldviews as a conscious or subconscious product of our experience and values, there are bound to be differences. In case of conflict because of differing worldviews, I think the guiding principle towards resolution of such conflict could be &#8216;what is for the greater good? &#8216;  Taking a step back and thinking about the collective good rather than personal gain ( or satisfaction), is a strategy that could possibly help resolve a lot of conflicts arising from differing worldviews. Others might argue that this would mean sacrificing one&#8217;s personal beliefs and agreeing to adopt someone else&#8217;s. I think we all are constantly trying to find the balance between being agreeable on one hand and staying true to one&#8217;s beliefs on the other. I would say that while persistence is a virtue, stubbornness is not.</p>

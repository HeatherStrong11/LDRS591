&nbsp;

<strong>Was the analysis process used rigorous qualitative procedures?</strong>

Russell et al., (2017) analyzed the qualitative data by hand, which required reading through the data and write notes and memos, then exploring the data as they indicated by “reading” and “rereading” as they explored the data, they also color-coded the different attributes. They used multiple stages of coding to note the relationships, then merged them to form selection for their themes. According to Plano-Clerk &amp; Creswell (2017), they didn’t use “verbatim” as part of data preparation (p.357). Since they used open-ended questions as part of a questionnaire which considered one type of the interview process for the researchers to use (Plano-Clerk &amp; Creswell, 2017, p.338), I believe its crucial to the precise extent.

Rate 2

&nbsp;

<strong>Did the researcher(s) use at least three strategies to validate the findings?</strong>

Russell et al., 2017) used one of the strategies; the triangulation of data sources from multiple participants, and had another researcher perform an analysis for comparison (p.85). In Plano-Clerk &amp; Creswell (2015) stated the four forms that frequently reported; Bracketing, Triangulation, member checking, auditing (p.

Rate 2

<strong>Did the findings include a good description of the people, places, or events in the study?</strong>

Russell et al., (2017) considered for-profit sectors, location, participants’ organizational position, gender, and age. They included the participants of the study in table 2 to show the organizational position of each participant and their for-profit sector. They included participants quotes and to the specific extent has some action words, which brings the description to life.

Rate 2

&nbsp;

<strong>Did the findings include appropriate themes about the central phenomenon?</strong>

There are seven themes reported in two attributes; the theme conveys the essential ideas about the central phenomenon. They included the theoretical finding with attributes and themes in table 3; also they provided participants quotes as evidence of their experiences (Russell et al., 2017, p.87). It was no sub-theme included.

Rate 2

<strong>Did the findings provide a good exploration of the central phenomenon?</strong>

The researchers report the relationships among the theme in the form of attributes that formed the theoretical findings. They were “validation as a leader and freedom from management.” They convey these relationships in table 3 (Russell et al., 2017, p.87), which emerged from the writings of 14 participants and appears to demonstrate “how the self-interest of a leader benefits by serving followers” Russell et al., 2017, p.92).

Rate 3

<strong>Did the data analysis represent a good qualitative process?</strong>

The data analysis was an inductive, interpretive and dynamic process presented through open-ended questions to coding the data and refining these codes to explicit the findings and form them as a theme. They reveal credible results to answer the study’s research question, despite the limitations which considered part of the systematic review.

Rate 3

<strong>Did the findings provide a good exploration of the central phenomenon?</strong>

In all parts, the findings provide rich and detailed information that answers the study’s research question.

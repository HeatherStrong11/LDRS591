I have always enjoyed reading and research in general, but given other commitments and responsibilities, I no longer have an infinite amount of time to spend on research. Thus, there are several factors I use to determine if an article is worth exploring further a consumer of research reports, the most important things for me in the introduction section of a high-quality research paper are:

<ul>
<li>A clear and succinct abstract.</li>
<li>Well written, direct and to the point. If it is difficult to locate the topic, purpose, and intent of the study, then I will likely lose interest.</li>
<li>The authors must explain why it is relevant, necessary, and the implications of their study.</li>
</ul>

As Dr. Atha is commonly heard saying, “be substantive and succinct.” If the study is substantive but succinct, it will likely pique my interest, and I will explore it further.

Are you someone that will read the end of a book before you start or even finish it? Are you guilty of doing the same with research articles, skipping to the discussion, or implication, or conclusion? Is it fair to eliminate studies that could be valuable if the introduction is poor? Why? Why not? Is the level of research limited by the author&#8217;s writing ability?

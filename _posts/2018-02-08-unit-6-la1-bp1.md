<strong>What research design was used to guide the study? Was it justified?</strong>

Chan &amp; So (2017) have created what I believe is a case study qualitative research study looking into the outcomes that a community-based project can have on students servant leadership development. The study based out of a K-12 International school in Hong Kong is based on fourteen secondary students and data is gathered using focus-group interviews. The reason I think it is a case study research design is that Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015) emphasize that this type of plan can be efficiently used for assessing a program or system on individuals. Chan &amp; So (2017) assign a program coordinator (a teacher at the school) to deliver the program and then evaluate the impact of the program on developing servant leadership characteristics in the participants. I think the research design is appropriate for the desired outcomes. Relevant considerations are evidenced throughout the work. Including the use of semi-structured interviews with prompts and allowing participants to share ideas with one another instead of one on one with the researcher.

<strong>Does the qualitative research design address the study’s purpose?</strong>

Chan &amp; So (2017 p.19) define the purpose of this study as &#8220;an exploration into a possible pathway to cultivate servant leadership attributes among learners in secondary schooling.&#8221; The qualitative research design aims to implement and evaluate this exploration process. I think using a case study approach is appropriate in this context. Using two research questions, they are trying to interpret whether servant leadership can be developed using a community program, and evaluate how servant leadership can be formed in secondary students.

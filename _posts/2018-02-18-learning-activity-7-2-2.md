The article I chose to focus on for this activity was Melchar and Bosco&#8217;s article <em>Achieving high organization performance through servant leadership</em>.

<ol>
<li>What was the purpose of the study?<br />
<strong>Rating: 3/3<br />
</strong>Melchar and Bosco (2010) clearly state at the beginning of their article that the purpose of their study was to determine &#8220;whether a servant leader can develop a corporate culture that attracts or develops other servant leaders&#8221; (p. 74).</li>
<li>Is there a rationale provided for needing a mixed methods design?<br />
<strong>Rating: 2/3<br />
</strong>The authors do not specifically state that this study was a mixed methods design (Melchar &amp; Bosco, 2010). Instead, they only refer to their research as an empirical study throughout the article (Melchar &amp; Bosco, 2010). However, the procedure is described in detail and thoroughly and the reader is able to identify the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the study (Melchar &amp; Bosco, 2010, p. 80).</li>
<li>Is the choice of the mixed methods design appropriate and justified?<br />
<strong>Rating: 3/3<br />
</strong>Yes, the Melchar and Bosco (2010) use a mixed methods design so that they can assess both the interactions between staff and leadership and also the empirical responses from questionnaires completed by employees (p. 80-81). Melchar and Bosco (2010) use a qualitative research design to interview leaders to assess their leadership style and to ensure that it meets the servant leadership criteria (p. 80) and a quantitative research design to collect questionnaire responses about employee perspective on leadership (p. 81).</li>
<li>What were the results of the study?<br />
<strong>Rating: 3/3<br />
</strong>The results of this study supported the original hypothesis that the &#8220;modelling of servant leadership by strategic level managers can create an organizational culture in which servant leaders develop among lower level managers&#8221; (Melchar &amp; Bosco, 2010, p. 84).</li>
<li>Does the use of mixed methods produce a good understanding of the study’s purpose?<br />
<strong>Rating: 3/3</strong><br />
Yes, the qualitative research portion of the study was important to understand the qualities that were needed to fulfill the requirement of the qualitative research portion (Melchar &amp; Bosco, 2010). The authors needed to address this criteria before moving forward with their empirical data collection and analysis (Melchar &amp; Bosco, 2010).</li>

I work in medium size laboratory-setting, and I have identified three problems at the workplace where I may apply action research to investigate and resolve the issue.

<strong>Increase absenteeism</strong> at the workplace, its one of the issues we face at work. Employee miss work for a variety of reasons, many of which are legitimate and others less so. Its an employee intentional or habitual absence from work. The idea behind this thought, is employee have specific numbers of sick days to use. They may make excuses to avoid coming into work and being overworked as a productive part of a team. But sometimes employees start taking sick days because of the stress of the workplace is too much. Sometime an urgent matter could affect the situation.<br />
In my situation, I have to fill the shift, and I might not be successful especially if it&#8217;s on short notice or the weekend. We do have schedulers who help us in replacing any sick calls. Still, this is an issue need to be addressed with action research involving the team lead, the employee, site supervisor, and manager.

<strong>Teamwor</strong>k is essential to me, it’s a requirement in daily bases at the workplace. It&#8217;s also a reflection on the functionality of workplace. Sometimes I find the employee lose their potential to be part of a productive team, or not able to function appropriately when increased workload. Therefore, creates a lot of negative impact on others in the team where the turn around time of work increase and loss of productivity. Still, this is an issue need to be addressed involving team lead, employee, site supervisor, and manager.

<strong>Loose motivation and disengagement</strong>, some employee they work for a long time in one place and feels that their efforts are not being recognized or appreciated, they will soon begin to lack energy and commitment in their role. I am trying to find reasons behind employees’ disengagement to find a resolution. This attitude at work could be contagious. I believe this is an issue to be addressed with action research involving team lead, the employee, site supervisor, and manager.

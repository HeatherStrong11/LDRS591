Hi Everyone,

I really enjoyed listening to all of your podcasts this weekend!  Well done.  I am glad to see that you all rose to the challenge to record yourself and post it on your blog.

I shared this with one learner yesterday over email but when I posted the unit 7 update through the audio recording I did that so that I knew what each of you would be experiencing this past week.  It was a challenging experience.   I had to write myself a script and then I practiced reading the script 3 or 4 times (and made changes each time) before I recorded myself.  Then when I did record myself I stumbled over my words 5 different times and had to re-do the recording each time.  It was frustrating and it took me a long time to produce a 2 minute audio clip.

I am sharing this with you to say thank you for rising to the challenge! The podcast was my way of getting each of you to do a presentation without having to do a video recording.  The face to face class had to do this assignment as a presentation in front of the entire class.

I hope you all enjoyed learning about, and thinking through, how to practically use research in your work contexts.  I look forward to reading your evaluations of your partners action research projects on your blogs this week.

Have a great week.

Dr. Strong

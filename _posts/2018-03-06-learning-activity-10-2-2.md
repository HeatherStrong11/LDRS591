<strong>In light of what you have learned in this course, prepare a blog post explaining why you think evidence-based decision making is important for the Transformational Servant leader.</strong>

Evidence-based decision making and Transformational Servant Leadership go hand-in-hand. When we speak about making decisions based on evidence, we are inevitably admitting that we do not have all the answers. To make decisions based on solid evidence means we are less concerned about popular opinion or previous experience. It requires a posture of humility as we acknowledge thatÂ  what we think is the best decision may not be the best decision. Humility is an essential quality for the transformational servant leader.

Evidence-based decision making also requires a healthy skepticism of one&#8217;s own opinions. As transformational servant leaders, we want to be leaders who are curious, teachable and learners. No matter how experienced an individual is in a specific field, it is hard to argue against evidence, especially when that evidence is collected through high quality studies. As I mentioned in my previous post, I have been amazed at how many studies have been done on different aspects of servant leadership. As I have sifted through them I have had the sense that there will always be more for me to learn on the topic, no matter how long I am in a leadership position for. Having a curious mind and a willingness to seek out new ways of leading is essential for a transformational servant leader to continue to grow and mature. Evidence is one of those things that is hard to argue with when it is the result of high quality research. Relying on evidence to inform decisions whenever possible will create a culture of humility, learning and unity and will equip the leader to make the best decision possible.

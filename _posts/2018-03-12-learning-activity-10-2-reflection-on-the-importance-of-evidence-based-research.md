<h3>Reflection on the Importance of Evidence</h3>

Evidence based research is essential for many different reasons. First through the research process the leader is continuing to be a learner. Those that are life long learners are the most equipped to lead from a more well rounded and experienced position. While transformational servant leaders work to build their followers up by leading from the bottom and providing the followers with leadership experience, this does not mean a leader gives up their leadership role. The transformational servant leader must be far more educated in the followers leading experience in order to properly assess, evaluate and guide the follower to greater success. This learning is most effective when the leader embraces common practices in their field. The leader must be equipped through a knowledge of modern understanding of their field, and this equipping comes from understanding current research on the subject. In order to understand how to help someone, one must understand the area that needs help, and be aware of current practices in that field. Evidence based decision making gives the leader a foundation upon which to make a decision. It provides the transformational servant leader with a body of research to make a more well rounded decision upon, without having to work through all of the possible variables independently before hand. It gives the leader foresight, which is essential in shaping the followers and providing them with safe opportunities for learning and transformation. We can make decisions without evidence based learning, but why would someone jump blindly into the dark when so many have gone before them to provide light and foresight?

As a consumer of research reports, the most important things for me in the methods and results section of a high-quality qualitative research report are&#8230;

<ol>
<li><strong>A credible sample </strong>that provides well-rounded and accurate results. The researchers&#8217; attention to finding the &#8220;right&#8221; participants where their characteristics such as race, sex, age, and culture is crucial to providing good data. As Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015) state, &#8220;[Purposeful sampling] is best suited for qualitative research because the researcher is able to select the individuals who are most appropriate for a study of the central phenomenon&#8221; (p. 332). There are limited participants, and finding the right participants to provide rich and meaningful information provides greater accuracy!</li>
<li><strong>Clear and rigorous procedures </strong>that offer credible data and analysis. Providing a clear framework of the study&#8217;s procedure not only helps readers understand the study, but also shows the attention the researchers implemented to provide consistency in their data collection. Also, their use of rigorous procedures that adhere to credible standards of qualitative studies that involves processes such as audits, triangulation, and bracketing reveals credibility in their results.</li>
<li><strong>A good presentation of data </strong>that clearly outlines and compares the data collected. Due to the nature of data collection in qualitative studies, there are lots of words as participants are interviewed or asked to complete a questionnaire and this can cause an overwhelming sight on a study. Providing a well structured presentation of the data with subtitles, charts, tables, and the researchers&#8217; interpretations help me understand the participants better and the data the researchers focused on and considered.</li>
</ol>

Question: I personally find it difficult to understand a study fully without a full documentation or example of the questions used to collect data from their participants &#8211; I like the details! Do you think it is important for researchers to provide all these questions and responses from participants, or do you find this unnecessary information?

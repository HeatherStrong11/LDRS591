<h3>Action Research Podcast Review</h3>
<h4>Does the project focus on a real problem in practice?</h4>
<p>Leona works at an organization that is open 24/7 and is attempting to create a means of minimizing the communication gaps and exclusion of staff that results from the problem of never being able to meet with all staff members at the same time. Initially I thought this problem was a feeling of exclusion that could potentially affect all staff members as they were completing work during meeting time, it appears that the problem could be rooted in the fact that auxiliary staff often do not attend meetings because they are not required to do so, and little connection is made with them after the meeting to ensure that they feel heard or supported.</p>
<h4>Does the researcher plan to study his or her own practices or plan to collaborate with community members?</h4>
<p>Leona plans to study the practices of the organization she works at, through an action research study. She plans to work directly with her team of 37 individuals. She looks to have the leadership teams approval and support in the development and application of the action research study.</p>
<h4>Does the project include careful reflection about the problem?</h4>
<p>She has reflected on the challenge of staff being unable to attend meetings and has a good understanding of the potential negative effects of staff missing out. She also reflects on the potential problem of staff not reading the minutes of the team meetings and provides a solution by meeting with staff individually.</p>
<h4>Does the researcher plan to gather several sources of information (e.g., qualitative and quantitative procedures)?</h4>
<p>Leona plans on using a quantitative study using 2 surveys. She will distribute instructions for the surveys through the team meeting minutes and will check up on staff individually if results are not returned. It appears the participation in the survey are mandatory for all team members. She has a well thought out system for participant response. She could have used a qualitative approach to give a better understanding of how team members feel about the communication issues. Qualitative research provides more individual perspective and might give alternate reasons for discontent amongst team members.</p>
<h4>Does the researcher develop a clear plan for addressing the problem?</h4>
<p>Leona has developed some strategies to minimize the problem of exclusion staff might feel, by recording meeting, having supervising staff meet with team members that could not attend meetings and work through the minutes with them.</p>
<h4>Does the project include reflecting, thinking, looking, and gathering information and acting?</h4>
<p>Leona appears to a have a well thought out research method, to understand the impact of how not being able to meet as a team affects each team member. Her hypothesis that permanent staff who are required to attend team meetings, will feel less exclusion than auxiliary staff who do not attend the meetings, seems like a well thought out hypothesis and makes sense.</p>
<h4>Will the results of the project enhance the lives of those involved?</h4>
<p>Creating better channels of communication between the two groups of staff will have a positive affect on the morale of all members of the team. By including all team members in the action research plan and giving them buy-in there will be positive change.</p>

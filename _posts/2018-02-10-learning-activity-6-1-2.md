For this activity, I chose to focus on Carter and Baghurst&#8217;s (2014) article <em>The Influence of Servant Leadership on Restaurant Employee Engagement</em>.

<li>What research design was used to guide the study? Was it justified?<br />
<strong>Rating: 3/3<br />
</strong>Carter and Baghurst (2014) used a phenomenological research design to study the effects of servant leadership on the experiences of 11 restaurant employees. This was the most appropriate research design to study the &#8220;lived experience&#8221; of servant leadership (Waters, 2017). Many of the sources that the authors cited were written within the last 10 years of the article&#8217;s publication date so recent and relevant literature was used. Since there is very little research on the effects of employee engagement as a result of servant leadership, the authors posit that their a phenomenological research design will &#8220;explore servant leadership from both a follower and leader perspective through personal examples in an effort to gain an understanding of the influence of servant leadership on employee engagement&#8221; (Carter &amp; Baghurst 2014, p. 455).</li>
<li>Does the qualitative research design address the study’s purpose?<br />
<strong>Rating: 3/3<br />
</strong>Yes, the phenomenological research designed allowed the researchers to interview 11 restaurant employees over a course of two months. They asked strategically chosen questions that allowed them to gauge how servant leadership from management affected the level of employee engagement at the restaurant (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014). Results showed that because of the environment of self-development and growth, employees were able to build meaningful relationships with their managers and their coworkers (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014, p. 462). This allowed employees to feel more ownership in their positions and to be more motivated to deliver exceptional service to customers (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014, p. 462).</li>

<p>This week in Unit 8 you will get a chance to explore Action Research.  According to Mutimbi and Khaila (2011, p.27):</p>
<blockquote><p>A standard research methods course at university emphasizes scientific ways of conducting research. Students are taught scientific methods of collecting data, analyzing it and reporting. They collect data and analyse it in ways that enable them to describe situations as they exist, and they come up with long ‘wish lists’ in the form of recommendations for others to implement. They become experts in analyzing and developing models to describe situations – <em>but they cannot change the situations</em>. In other words, they are taught to describe problems, but not to solve them. These methods are not suitable for workers who are grappling with real life issues and are looking for ways of helping solve their problems. They need research approaches and methods that enable them to generate data that they can use to solve problems.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what is action research? &#8220;It is a disciplined process of inquiry conducted <i>by</i> and <i>for</i> those taking the action&#8221; (Sagor, 2000, para. 1). Its purpose is to solve local/practical problems through the application of systematic investigation.  The problem is local, the investigation is local, and there is little concern for generalizing results to other settings.</p>
<p>Action research may employ virtually any research methodology, and will commonly be conducted collaboratively with other professionals.  Action research differs from more formal research in some important ways that you will uncover in the readings this week.</p>
<p>Your learning activities this week are a little different.  Specifically, you are asked to create an idea for an action research project based on one of the practical problems you have identified from your professional life. You will present this project idea in a podcast for your colleagues. Audio I and Audio II in the Digital Literacy section of the orientation will explain how to set up your podcast. You can find the link to the orientation <a href="https://create.twu.ca/orientation/#Digital_Literacy">here.</a></p>
<p><strong>Reminder: </strong>Make sure you take some time to practice what you are going to say (I highly recommend creating a script) and give yourself lots of time to record, make mistakes, re-record, make more mistakes, take a break, re-record and then post it on your blog.  Have fun!</p>

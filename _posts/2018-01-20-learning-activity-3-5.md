<p>In this study, the authors found that &#8220;the use of metacognitive and help seeking strategies all had significant positive correlations with pre-class and in-class math achievements&#8221; (Sun, Zie, &amp; Anderman, 2018, p. 47).</p>

<p>The authors had these suggestions for educational practice:</p>
<p>Based on these findings, we suggest that teachers should help students build their confidence of learning math and help them believe they are able to succeed in learning math. Bandura (1997) argued that experiencing success was one of the key sources of self-efficacy. For pre-class activities, teachers should select and structure the online lectures, learning tasks, and assignments in way that are suitable for the development of students&#8217; mathematics reasoning so they experience small successes early in the course to help develop their confidence to learn advanced topics later in the course. (Sun et al, 2018, p. 49)</p>

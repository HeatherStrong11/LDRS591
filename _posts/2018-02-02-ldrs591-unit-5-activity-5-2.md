<p>Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015) provide a seven criteria for &#8220;evaluating the participants and data collection in a quantitative report&#8221; (p. 249). I will rate Jenkins &amp; Stewart&#8217;s (2010) study according to the seven criteria below:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The sampling strategy is appropriate and justified (2/3) </strong>&#8211;  Jenkins &amp; Stewart (2010) do not explicitly explain the reasoning for their sampling strategy, but they do explain the benefits of the &#8220;large, multidivisional health care system&#8221; (p. 49) they chose to sample and the use of a survey is good measure of understanding an individual&#8217;s personal background and satisfaction with their workplace. Weaknesses in this area include a lack of clarity in their procedure and variety in their sample size due to the restrictions found in sampling a single health care system. Providing an example of the four questionnaires used would be greatly beneficial.</li>
<li><strong>The sample size is appropriate and justified (1/3) </strong>&#8211; Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015) state a survey study should have &#8220;approximately 350 individuals (or more)&#8221; (p. 238) participating in the survey, and should provide &#8220;an explanation as to why this [sample size] was used&#8221; (p. 237). Although Jenkins &amp; Stewart (2010) justify the reason for choosing the specific health care system they surveyed, they only received 210 completed surveys and do not provide further explanations to why they chose their sample size.</li>
<li><strong>High quality instruments are used to gather data (3/3) </strong>&#8211; Jenkins &amp; Stewart (2010) used &#8220;Barbuto and Wheeler&#8217;s (2006) 23-item survey&#8221; (p. 50) which measured each item &#8220;using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from <em>strongly agree </em>to <em>strongly disagree&#8221; </em>(p. 50); the average of these scores were then  turned to <em>z-scores</em>. Besides using this tested survey instrument, the researchers also examined &#8220;the reliability of the instrument&#8221; (p. 50) by &#8220;examining it relative to accepted measures of transformational leadership&#8221; (p. 50).</li>
<li><strong>The data gathered using ethical quantitative procedures (3/3) </strong>&#8211; &#8220;Participants were ensured confidentiality, and data were collected without identifiers&#8221; (Jenkins &amp; Stewart, 2010, p. 249) to &#8220;prevent the risk of harm to participants. This demonstrated Jenkins &amp; Stewart&#8217;s (2010) consideration and respect for their participants&#8217; career and relationships in their work places.</li>
<li><strong>The data are gathered using standardized quantitative procedures (2/3) </strong>&#8211; The researchers generally provided a consistent procedure to the distribution of the survey as most nurses received the the survey during &#8220;scheduled staff meetings&#8221; (p. 49), but for those who did not attend, the directions were given in a packet and the researchers could not enforce the completion of these surveys in similar conditions. Furthermore, it is unknown what specific questions were given to participants to judge whether the questions were &#8220;closed-ended questions&#8221; (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 249)</li>
<li><strong>The study has a high level of internal validity (2/3) </strong>&#8211; The study measured important variables such as commitment to serve and satisfaction, and used a valid experimental design procedure. A limitation mentioned is that job satisfaction as a dependent variable &#8220;does not reflect the multidimensional nature of the concept&#8221; (Jenkins &amp; Stewart, 2010, p. 52).</li>
<li><strong>The study has high level of external validity (1/3)</strong> &#8211; The study considers control variables such as &#8220;gender, ethnicity, and self-reported score on the individual&#8217;s most recent performance evaluation&#8221; (Jenkins &amp; Stewart, 2010, p. 249), but the sample size is not large enough, and the focus on a single health care system is not a representative sample. Jenkins &amp; Stewart (2010) acknowledge the limitation of this sample size as &#8220;there could be some systemic bias that remains within the data&#8221; (p. 53).</li>

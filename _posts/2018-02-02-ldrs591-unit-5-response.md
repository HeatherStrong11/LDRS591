<p>This is a response to <a href="https://create.twu.ca/layla11/2018/02/02/unit-5-learning-activity-5-4/">Layla&#8217;s post</a>.</p>
<p>Hi Layla,</p>
<p>You asked: How do you evaluate the results of a quantitative study when the information of the statistics or instruments is not clear enough? For me, if the statistical information and details of the instruments are not clearly explained, I dismiss the study as valid.</p>
<p>The importance of quality and credibility of a study has been discussed time and time again, and as our learning activities emphasized this week, a lack of indicators that explain the use of an instrument or lack of analysis of the results indicate low quality results and data collection processes. Beyond failing Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell&#8217;s (2015) evaluation process, I would not use an article with more explanations because IÂ  would simply not understand the study in full.</p>
<p>If I cannot understand the results or the instruments they used to produce the results, I do not have faith in the study or my interpretation of the study. Without understanding the process and the resulting statistics, I would find a hard time connecting the results with the purpose of the study. Also, I have a short attention span and would not find it worth my efforts to dig into this study further if the writing of the article poorly explains these important details.</p>
<p>How do you handle the ambiguity of unclear procedures and statistical results?</p>

<pre><code>The study I chose to examine was the article titled ‘Correlation Analysis of Servant Leadership and School Climate’ by Glenda Black. I would rate the study a three in each category. The purpose was to find out whether or not there was a relationship servant leadership and school climate. The findings concluded that when people believe servant leadership is at work there is a positive impact on school climate. The rationale given for using mixed methods was actually provided using a quote from Crewell, “Quantitative data provides for generalizability whereas qualitative data offers information about the context or setting” (Creswell, 2005, p. 515). The study wanted to provide the best of both worlds when it came to methods of research.

The choice of using mixed methods design is appropriate and justified as it produces a good understanding of the study’s purpose. By taking on qualitative research the article was able to give a solid background knowledge. Trends and previous studies were also given, such as the Lambert study that showed the relationship between servant leadership in schools and good academic achievement in students (Black, 2013, p. 460). The study also had numerical data and statistics thus qualifying it within the realms of quantitative data. The following is a quote that showcases both:

“First, the research study consisted of gathering quantitative survey data from a sample of elementary school principles and teachers. Second, post survey qualitative data were gathered from 10% of the sample, as determined by implementing a nonprobablity sampling technique or until no new theme emerged” (Black, 2013, p. 447).

<pre><code>Overall, I believe mixed methods research was an excellent choice for this article. I think it gave more perspective and was more convincing for me as a consumer of research in this field.

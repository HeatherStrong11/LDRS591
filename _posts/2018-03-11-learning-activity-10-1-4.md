<p>In unit 1, I discussed the factors that influence my decision-making process as a leader. I explained how my personal beliefs and values, the mission, vision, and value statement of the organization, research, and the examining the big picture all play a role in my decision making.</p>
<p>First, I would ask myself, “Is my decision consistent an faithful to my faith in Christ?”.</p>
<p>Second, “Does my decision align with the mission, vision, and values of the organization?”</p>
<p>Third, “Is my decision aligned with best practices? Does evidence support it?”</p>
<p>Finally, “Does my decision support the overall growth of the organization?”</p>
<p>As the course comes to an end my overall approach to making decisions has changed very little. However, the course has refined my research skills which have allowed me how to be more efficient at locating relevant and reliable sources, it introduced different research designs and provided a thorough overview of APA.</p>
<p>Time is our most valuable commodity, and the course has provided many helpful tips that I can use to maximize my time when attempting to locate relevant articles but also evaluate them. Online databases can be overwhelming, but if one has the right tools to navigate them, then they can become a powerful tool when conducting research. LDRS 591 has not only provided those tools but also allowed each one of us to apply them and witness how valuable they can be.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, time is valuable, and once it is gone, we can never get it back. I often find myself reading and scanning articles longer then I ought to. The course has taught us how to efficiently and effectively evaluate each section of research studies to determine if it is worth the time one must spend to read and comprehend it. There is no point citing a study that is not credible or reliable, LDRS591 has shown me how to determine the credibility and reliability in a time-efficient manner.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important thing I learned was how I could apply the research in my personal and professional life, specifically action research. I could spend hours upon hours reading a research study about this and that, but what good is it if I cannot apply it to our personal or professional lives? Action research provides a simple model anyone can use in their own lives to solve real problems they are facing.</p>

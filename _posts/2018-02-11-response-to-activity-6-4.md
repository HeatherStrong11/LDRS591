<p>I have mostly been exposed to quantitative studies in medical journals. They always have a pre determined methods and procedures and are flexible. The idea that a study can change course midway in my mind was always questionable practice.. But as we learnt from this section on qualitative studies, they are by nature &#8220;explorative&#8221;, (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015). I have a better understanding now of what a qualitative study entails. Reading a qualitative research report entails a lot of critical thinking on part of the reader, and integrity on part of  the researchers. If the researchers decide to change their procedures during the study, they must make sure they explain well their reasons. The reader on the other hand must keep an open mind, and evaluate the researchers&#8217; reasons critically, and reason whether the change in procedures affected the validity of the study.</p>

<p>This is a response to Leona post found here: <a href="https://create.twu.ca/soleona/2018/01/28/ldrs591-unit-4-activity-4-5/">https://create.twu.ca/soleona/2018/01/28/ldrs591-unit-4-activity-4-5/</a></p>
<p>Leona&#8217;s questions are: What detracts you from reading a certain study? Do you have an example of a time where you could not will yourself to read past the introduction?</p>
<p>There are three things which would detract me from reading a study. First, too much literature containing in a study makes me feel exhausted during reading it. I think we all understand that the literature is one of the most important elements in a study. But it does not happen to be a good thing if the literature is the more the better. The author has to pick up the most useful articles to strongly support his idea, and the quantity of the literature should be contained in a reasonable amount. Second, the subtitles of the study are not clear enough. We can gain from the learning activities of this week that there are several principal parts of an article, such as the purpose of statement, literature review, and method section. If the subtitles were not clear or did not separate the whole article into distinct parts, it would make the reader boring. At last, my personal preference would affect me in reading different types of articles. For example, I am very interested in psychology. Therefore, regardless of the major content and the length, reading an article about psychology will make me excited and energetic. To the contrary, I am not a fan of the business. Any article related to business would make me sleepy during reading it.</p>
<p>I do have an example that perfectly reveals the third factor mentioned in the last paragraph. Last year, I had one assignment about writing an argumentative essay of physician-assisted death. I planned to write it from different perspectives including national law, religions, and health-care. Then I found myself extremely reluctant to review the articles related to law. I even could not finish reading the introduction part. I thought that I did not familiar with the terminologies of law. At last, I admitted to myself that it was actually because I was not interested in this realm.</p>
<p>When conducting a study, we could not imagine what kind of source or knowledge might be useful. Obviously, we all have our preference for different types. But, I deem the attitude towards scholar inquiry should be unbiased, and our personal preference should be placed in a lower hierarchy during conducting a study.</p>

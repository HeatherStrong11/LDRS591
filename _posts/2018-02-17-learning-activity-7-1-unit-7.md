The heart of the quantitative/qualitative debate is research problem and the purposeful approach. Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) assert that “a quantitative research approach indicated when the research problem requires an explanation, while qualitative research approach indicated when the research problem requires exploration” (p.85-86). The argument in qualitative research is to explore the central phenomenon to develop and report description and themes (p.287). On the other side, the argument in the quantitative research is, the research problems call for explanation and measuring trends or variables to develop and report the results that are objectively compared with predictions and past studies (p.193).

Plano-Clerk &amp; Creswell (2015) stated, “many of today’s research problem calls for both explanation and exploration” (p.381). Also added, authors combined these two datasets to develop a complete understanding of the different modes of communication, and the consequences of the use which lead to answer the research question (p.383). Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015) proposed and explained; the Mixed method is appropriate when researchers need to combine the strengths of quantitative and qualitative data, build from one type of data to the other, and to answer two research questions (p.385-386).

Thinking of using a combination of qualitative and quantitative data can improve an evaluation by ensuring that the strengths of another balance the limitations of one type of data. Therefore, providing that understanding enhanced by integrating different ways of knowing. Evaluation of invested both quantitative data (numbers) and qualitative data (text, images) disclose the importance of planning how these will be combined.  Stentz, J. E., Plano-Clark, V. L., &amp; Matkin, G. S. (2012) stated, “researchers can maximize the strengths of each approach while making up for the weaknesses of the approaches, develop complete and complementary understandings, increase validity of results, use one form to build on the results of the other, and/or examine contextualized understandings, multi-level perspectives, and cultural influences&#8221; (p.1174).

Also, “quantitative approaches (such as surveys, correlational studies, or experiments) provide opportunities for analyzing existing leadership approaches, combining them with qualitative approaches (such as content analysis, case study, or grounded theory) can support new discoveries within the realm of existing leadership theory” (Stentz et al., 2012, p1174)

Applying both quantitative and qualitative approaches, the GLOBE researchers were able to uncover new understandings about cross-cultural interactions and how culture impacts leader effectiveness and in a way that is generalizable between cultures and within cultures around the world. (Northhouse, 2013).

Although &#8220;the GLOBE researchers used an overall quantitative approach for purposes of scientific validity, they applied a mixed methods approach within their multi-phase, multi-method project by embedding content analysis of interviews, focus groups, and published media (representing qualitative approaches) to capture richly descriptive culture-specific interpretations to account for cultural influences on leadership&#8221; (House et al., 2001).

I believe it’s a valuable approach to specific extent solving a problem and answer the research question. Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015) they provided in-depth different mixed method research design for scholars to amplify the intent of research and to produce the complete analysis results (390-403). Mixed method research appears to have an abroad insight and era on too many fields like healthcare, management, social science, leadership theory and its application.

Question: How many research question I can include in mixed method research design?

Hi Everyone,

I wanted to provide you with a few resources, based on the questions and comments that were provided in unit 5 on Quantitative Research Methods and Results.

Here is a short video by David H. Schwartz (April 28, 2014) that explains why not all quantitative studies are created equal.

I am also providing you with a link to a really helpful website that has been created by Dr. Andy Field.  Dr. Field goes into much more detail about everything you need to know about statistics than the course textbook.  Here is the website: <a href="https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/">https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/</a>  If there is something that you don&#8217;t understand when you are reading through the results section of a quantitative research study, search Dr. Field&#8217;s website.  This is a great tutorial to start with:

<p>Have a great week!

As a consumer of research reports, the most important things for me in the methods and results section of a high-quality qualitative research report are (1) a detailed description of the procedures and (2) evidence that steps were taken to check the validity of the data collected.

<ol>
<li>It is important to have a detailed description of the procedures so that the reader and future researchers can replicate the study and make adjustments for future research. As well, a detailed description allows other researchers who are reading the study to identify weaknesses or strengths in the process, which allows for better assessment of the results. I would be weary of the results drawn from a data collection process that is unclear or vague.</li>
<li>Evidence of data validation is important because of the general subjective nature of qualitative studies. As a student with a mathematics and science background, I am used to seeing results derived from empirical data and calculations. It is sometimes difficult for me to accept qualitative data as facts. However, reading about methods used to validate data allows me better understand that solid results can be drawn from qualitative observations and responses.</li>
</ol>

My question is: <strong>Is it possible to combine a qualitative and quantitative study? For example, could a researcher include an empirical data collection method as well as a qualitative response method into one study? What would be the benefits and disadvantages of doing so? </strong>

What are some red flags shown in methodology that can lead to discounting the quality of a research paper?

I believe lack of prior research, sample size, measures used to collect the data, lack of reliable data should flag you when you do your research paper.

Have your standard measure at the beginning of your review, and ability to acknowledge your limitation will help out in troubleshooting the undesirable outcomes if its present. Understanding the critique of the statistics used help you to find what measures needed in the study and how to interpret them to relate to your research paper if its required.

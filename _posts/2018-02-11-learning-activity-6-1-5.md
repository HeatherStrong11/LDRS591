First, the purpose statement identifies a process to explore and the need to fill a gap in present theories.  Second, the researchers collected data through interviews, from multiple people with different experiences and perspectives. Third, the researchers analyzed data using multiple stages of coding. Finally, the researchers described the categories and themes found within the data and their relation to each other in theory, and they developed a theory which they explained in text and through visual means. (Plano-Clarke &amp; Creswell 2015, p. 297 – 298)</span></span><span style="margin: 0px;font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;font-size: 12pt"><span style="color: #000000"> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="margin: 0px;line-height: 107%;font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;font-size: 12pt"><span style="color: #000000">The researchers asked two research questions. First, “Can servant leadership training be a part of a secondary school co-curriculum program?” (2017, p. 19) Second, “How is servant leadership developed in learners at a secondary school?” (2017, p. 19) The authors of the study were justified in using grounded theory as the research design addressed the purpose of their study. The purpose of the study was to, “explore a possible pathway to cultivate servant leadership attributes among learners in secondary schooling.” (Chan &amp; So, 2017, p. 19) Moreover, Chan &amp; So recognized the need to develop a broad theory addressing the development of servant leadership in secondary learners, aged 15 to 17 as there was a hole in recent research. Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell explain the purpose of grounded theory is, “to generate theory about a process, action, or interaction.” (2015, p. 301) Thus, Chan &amp; So research design successfully addressed the study’s purpose, which allowed them to create a “Framework of Servant Leadership Development for Adolescent Learners.” (Chan &amp; So, 2017, p.19)</span></span></p>

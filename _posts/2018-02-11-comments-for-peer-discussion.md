<h3>Comment on <a href="https://create.twu.ca/icandothis/2018/02/11/ldrs-591-activity-6-4-2/#comment-118">Simarjit Shergill&#8217;s Learning Activity 6.4</a></h3>

In regards to your question, I felt the same way. The reader need put a lot of trust in the researcher if the analysis tools or questions are not given. In the article I read (Chan &amp; So, 2017) I felt that the participant quotes couldnâ€™t be shown as valid evidence if we were not given the questions. The participant quotes could have been prompted or guided by the interviewer, regardless of the fact that it was preformed as a focus group.

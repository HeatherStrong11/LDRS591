<p>For this activity, I chose to focus on Carter and Baghurst’s (2014) article <em>The Influence of Servant Leadership on Restaurant Employee Engagement</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Did the researcher(s) use at least three strategies to validate the findings?<br />
<strong>Rating: 3/3<br />
</strong>Yes, the authors checked the validity of their results through careful participant selection, triangulation, a modified van Kaam method (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014, p. 456). Careful participation selection was employed by recruiting participants through carefully written emails and assuring each employee of the confidentiality of their responses (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014, p. 456). This was necessary so that employees would not feel obligated to participate or feel that their employment would be affected by their participation, or lack thereof, in the study  (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014, p. 456). Triangulation of survey responses and work observations were done on the data collected as well  (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014, p. 456). Lastly, Carter and Baghurst (2014) used a modified van Kaam method to sort and group the data collected (p. 456).</li>
<li>Did the findings include a good description of the people, places, or events in the study?<br />
<strong>Rating: 3/3<br />
</strong>Yes, the findings included a thorough description of the process and procedure of the study  (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014, p. 455-459). The authors specified the location of the focus groups, which was at the restaurant for the sake of comfort and convenience for the participants  (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014, p. 455). The authors listed all five questions asked in the focus groups as well as the general theme of the answers given by the participants  (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014, p. 457-459).</li>
<li>Did the findings include appropriate themes about the central phenomenon?<br />
<strong>Rating: 3/3<br />
</strong>Yes, the authors grouped their findings into five themes regarding servant leadership (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014, p. 459-460). The themes were servant leadership experience, why people stay, servant leadership traits, impact of servant leadership, and application of servant leadership (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014, p. 459-460).</li>
<li>Did the findings provide a good exploration of the central phenomenon?<br />
<strong>Rating: 3/3<br />
</strong>Yes, the authors discussed the findings and and made insightful and detailed connections to servant leadership (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014, p. 459-460).</li>

<p>Dear Learners,</p>
<p>This blog post is to provide you with more information about what happens after 591 is complete. For the next two weeks you will be working on completing your Formal Literature Review Paper for 591.  Once 591 is done, you may begin your Leadership Integration Project (LIP).</p>
<p>The Leadership Integration Project (697/698) consists of a total of four credit hours of work, the first 2 credit hours is for 697, followed by another 2 credit hours for 698.  This course represents the final demonstration of a learner’s ability to integrate knowledge learned in the program curriculum and to practice the MA Leadership competencies.  Information about the LIP can be found here: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/lt3ralpyvut3c8r/LIPOrientation.mp4?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/lt3ralpyvut3c8r/LIPOrientation.mp4?dl=0</a></p>
<p>At the end of this week I will pair you with a faculty member who will supervise your Leadership Integration Project for the duration of LDRS 697/698.  The advising process involves a series of discussions between the student and the advisor on leadership development and value added to workplace issues.  There is one pre-work assignment and 5 assignments required for completion of 697/698.</p>
<p>Once, you have submitted your formal literature review paper for 591, please register for 697 so that you have access to all of the course materials on Moodle.  After, you have registered for 697, then contact your advisor to set an appointment time for your first advising session.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any questions after viewing the slide presentation.</p>
<p>Dr. Strong</p>

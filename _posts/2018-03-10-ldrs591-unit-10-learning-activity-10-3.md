<p><strong>How credible are research studies?</strong></p>
<p>Apparently, humans are the weakest link along the credibility chain of research. I find this both ironic and intriguing considering that humans are also the ultimate beneficiaries of research. How I wished research could be error-free! Thankfully, there exists frameworks that could help with determining the credibility of research studies.</p>
<p>To know if I could trust what I am reading, I would evaluate its source, specifically, the publisher and author(s). I would also evaluate the contents for possible technical errors or inconsistencies with the research questions and findings. Lastly, I would look out for possible indicators of conflicting interests by evaluating sponsor(s), if any, the possibility that data was tampered with or deliberately removed, and, bogus claims made in the study.</p>
<p>In furtherance of the above, I would evaluate the source to see if it was peer reviewed and that the requirements for submission are appropriate. Where necessary, especially if the study proposes foundational work, I would evaluate the authorâ€™s reputation/credentials. I would examine the research design to see if it was appropriate for the research questions or study intent. In addition, I would examine the sampling technique to ascertain if it was information-rich or allowed for generalization of results, depending on the research design. Lastly, I would ensure that I am able to form an independent opinion of the findings and then, compare with findings reported by the author(s) or findings from existing literature, including those the author(s) may have provided, to see if there are consistencies.</p>
<p>By completing the above, I would have successfully evaluated if the research was performed competently, reported honestly, and, has findings consistent with other studies.</p>
<p>I would like to conclude by asking if the punishments for deliberately authoring or publishing misleading research are effective and serve as deterrents.</p>

<h3>Statements of the Problem</h3>

Using the evaluation criteria on p. 93, answer the following questions to evaluate the statement of the problem in the servant leadership article you chose to focus on. The figure on page 94 provides a template for recording your rating and rationale.

<h4>Is the topic interesting? (3)</h4>

The topic of servant leadership is both interesting and applicable to many areas of society.  Paris and Peachey begin with a general statement on large amount of research being done on the topic of leadership (2013. p. 377). This broad topic brings interest to readers of many backgrounds.

<h4>Is there a meaningful problem? (3)</h4>

The problem identified in both the abstract (Parris &amp; Peachey, 2013. p. 377) and the introductory paragraphs (Parris &amp; Peachey, 2013. p. 378) is the need for a comprehensive summary on the empirical research being done about servant leadership. They further broke this idea down into the following questions:

<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<blockquote>(a) How was servant leadership defined? (b) In what contexts was servant leadership theory empirically investigated? (c) How was servant leadership examined (i.e., the meth- odology)? and (d) What were the results of the examination? (Parris &amp; Peachey, 2013. p. 378)</p></blockquote>

<h4>Is the importance of the problem justified? (3)</h4>

Parris and Peachey describe how there are studies on leadership coming from a variety of sources, but the need to bring them together to review them methodologically and analyze them for bias and accuracy. The importance of the problem seems justified, as they reference Russle and Stone (2002), <strong>(</strong>Barbuto and Wheeler 2006) and Van Dierendonck 2011 as recent literary sources.

<h4>Are there deficiencies in the knowledge about the problem? (3)</h4>

The defences are listed in the above question as a lack of mythological analysis through a systematic approach using empirical method to review a vast amount of research on the topic of servant leadership.

<h4>Is an audience identified and are there specific examples of how the audience can use the missing knowledge? (1)</h4>

The audience appears to be members of academia studying the topic of servant leadership, and Parris and Peachey provide them with a review of the theories of servant leadership and further areas of possible research (2013. p. 379, 389-390). They began with the idea that this topic is applicable to a wide array of readers, but it appears that their research is being done for academics who are planning to do further research in the area of leadership. Paris and Peachey do not appear to have written this article with the intent to provide a framework for developing servant leadership in a real world situation as first implied (2013. p.378)

<h4>Does the passage clearly argue that the study is warranted? (2)</h4>

They provided a qualitative and quantitative review of the data collected on the topic of servant leadership. The fact that a study like this was not done prior and the fact that the topic is relatively new to academia provide some warrant for their study.

<h4>Is the passage well written? (3)</h4>

It is clear and concise. Analysis on the methodology is clear and simple. Terminology is explained in a way that a variety of readers can understand. Paris and Peachey write with a professional style and vocabulary, while being accessible to to many readers by not focusing on concepts to challenging or academic.

<h4>Article Review</h4>

Parris and Peachey wrote an article that upon first reading seemed to be applicable to a wide range of audiences but is more directed towards academic&#8217;s researching the topic of servant leadership. They provide wide range of ideas studied about servant leadership. They also provide areas that need further research. In general, their article is useful and interesting. It provides many sources for someone who wished to go deeper into the topic of servant leadership and provides an overview of the main ideas of servant leadership. I would rate the article on a whole as a 2.5 or a 3. It is 18/21 on the scale recommended in Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015. p. 94) and thus it is a High Quality article.

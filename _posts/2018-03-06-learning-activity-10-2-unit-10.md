<strong>Why you think evidence-based decision making is important for the Transformational Servant leader.</strong>

Evidence-based decision-making it’s a strategy offered by transformational servant leader. It&#8217;s evidence-based, not assumption-based. (Northouse, 2013) Stated, “transformational leadership is a process that changes and transforms people” (p.185). Also, “it’s a process that often incorporates charismatic and visionary leadership.” (Greenleaf, 1970) proposed, “Servant leaders have the natural feeling that ones want to serve, to serve first” (as cited in Northhouse, 2013).

Spears (2002) identified ten characteristics of servant leaders, listening and understanding is a strategy that SL uses to communicate with followers, and Northhouse (2013) suggested, transformational leadership and servant leadership as a process that occurs between followers and leaders.<br />
In the transformational leadership theory, (Bass, 1985) noted that “increases followers awareness of problems and encourages followers to view old and familiar issues from a new perspective” (as cited in Washington, Sutton, and Sauser (2014).

Northhouse (2013) acknowledged, “One of the transformational leadership behavior, is to stimulate followers to be creative and innovative and to challenge their own believes and values. So, it supports followers to try a new approach and develop an innovative way of dealing with organizational issues” (p.193). On the other hand, servant leaders help followers grow and succeed through mentoring and providing support, Therefore, empowering the followers and make them own their decision and be self- sufficient.<br />
Leaders need to understand and adapt to the needs and motives of followers, Which explained their concern about how the leaders able to inspire followers to accomplish great things. It seems they assess follower’s motives and satisfy their needs, thus, requires having evidence-based decision-making strategy (Northhouse, 2013).

Schaubroeck, Lam, and Peng (2011) argued that trust in the leader is critical to linking leader behaviors and team performance and that transformational leadership and servant leadership represent general tendencies of leaders to engage in behaviors that inspire their followers’ trust. Washington, Sutton, and Sauser (2014) noted, servant leadership theory shares much in common with other modern theories of leadership, especially transformational leadership theory.

Coetzer, Bussin, and Geldenhuys, (2017) insured “On an individual level servant leadership positively influenced work engagement, organizational citizenship behavior, creativity and innovation, organizational commitment, trust, self-efficacy, job satisfaction, person-job fit or person-organizational fit, leader-member exchange, and work-life balance.” Hanse, Harlin, Jarebrant, Ulin, and Winkel, (2016) concluded, Servant leaders want to develop a sustainable organization and bring out the best among followers rather than their own self-interest. Coetzer, Bussin, &amp; Geldenhuys,( 2017) stated, “Servant leadership proposes a more meaningful way of leadership to ensure sustainable results for individuals, organizations, and societies”(p.1).

Conceptual-based concerned with emotions, values, ethics, standards, and long-term goals. Decision makers cannot assume that followers will be committed to a decision without being part of the process. Evidence-based decision -making helps TSL make well-informed decisions by having the best available evidence and managed outcome.

The transformational servant leader can articulate a compelling vision and galvanize collective action, communicate messages in meaningful ways, and operate in an innovative, inclusive, intellectually stimulating manner. Such actions change cultures and have the potential to lead to the development of contexts conducive to organizational change. Compiling vision and ability to conceptualize a higher vision, is a role of transformational servant leaders.

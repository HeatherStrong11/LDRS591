This is a response to Rob TegelBerg&#8217;s post <a href="https://create.twu.ca/robtegelberg/2018/02/11/learning-activity-6-4-response-to-unit-6/">https://create.twu.ca/robtegelberg/2018/02/11/learning-activity-6-4-response-to-unit-6/</a>

Question: Which method of research would you likely use if you were going to turn your LDRS 591 research question into a full research study and why?

There is a great chance for me to choose a quantitative research because my research question is how to effectively help the adolescents manage their anxiety disorders and academic performance in the school setting. My study first will aim at exploring the relationship between academic performance and anxiety disorders of adolescent youth. The second aim is to examine whether a school-based intervention would facilitate the treatment of anxiety disorder and enhance the academic performance at the same time.

Since I want to describe the relationship between two variables, I will gather the data of dependent variable, independent variable, control variables, and confounding variables. Performance measure, attitude measure, and behavioural observation might be the instruments used to collect data. Unfortunately, I am weak at analyzing statistics and a little confused about the analysis software. I will work on it before the beginning of my study. Then I might choose a true experiment research design in my research. Therefore, I will have an intervention and state a research purpose focusing on testing the effect of the intervention. I am still not sure about the site and the participants because I want to consider more about the effect of different cultures and different geographical areas. But there will be two treatment groups including an intervention group and a control group, and the participants will be randomly assigned to the groups.

Those are all the details of the method I can think of right now. We all need to be well prepared for our study, and the procedures must be well-thought-out. I believe it is common to have confusions and to make mistakes during the research. That is why peer review is always highlighted for a study.

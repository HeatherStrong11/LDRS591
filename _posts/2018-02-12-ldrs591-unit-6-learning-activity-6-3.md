The following is my evaluation of the data analysis and findings in the study by Russell, Maxfield, &amp; Russell, (2017). I performed the evaluation by applying criteria provided by Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015, p. 377).

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>The analysis process used rigorous qualitative procedures</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

I agreed that the study made use of rigorous qualitative procedures for the following reasons; first, the researchers collected data via an online database (p. 84). I believe this automatically provided soft copies of the gathered data and eliminated the need for verbatim transcripts. Second, they reported reading through the data, and writing memos (p. 86). Lastly, they analysed data using a hand coding process by identifying and developing codes until they reached a saturation point (p. 86).

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>At least three strategies were used to validate the findings </strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 2/3</strong>

The study showed that the researchers “triangulated data sources from multiple participants, had another researcher perform an analysis for comparison…” (Russell et al., 2017, p. 85). This implies that the researchers used triangulation and audit strategies to validate their findings.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>The findings included a description of people, places or events in the study</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 1/3</strong>

The findings did not include any description of the context of the study; there was no broad-to-narrow form, or any of the indicators specified in the evaluation criteria by Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015, p. 377).

<strong> </strong>

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>The findings included appropriate themes about the central phenomenon</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 2/3</strong>

A summary of the findings revealed a total of eight themes grouped under two attributes. These attributes led to the key finding that “leaders realize personal benefits from serving the needs of followers.” (p. 87). I observed that only 4 out of 8 themes had sub-themes. Also, multiple perspectives and participant quotes were used with these themes. Lastly, I observed that there were no comparison tables for the themes. (pp. 87-92).

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>The findings related multiple themes to each other</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

Absolutely! This was evident in the summary of the findings which was, “leaders realize personal benefits from serving the needs of followers.” (p. 86). The findings also showed that the themes were all related through two attributes; (a) validation as a leader, and, (b) freedom from management.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>The data analysis represented a good qualitative process</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 2/3</strong>

The limitations of the study show that among others, the data analysis was inductive, interpretive, and dynamic; leading to credible results. However, the researchers used only two strategies to validate the findings, not three as suggested by Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015, p. 377).

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>The findings provided a good exploration of the central phenomenon</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

Absolutely! The study sought to discover how individual leaders perceived the benefits derived from serving the needs of their followers. (p. 75). The findings included eight themes, and, the relationships among these themes. It also included a discussion that answered the research question by exploring how “leaders realize personal benefits from serving the needs of followers” (p. 92) through the following attributes; validation as a leader and freedom from management.

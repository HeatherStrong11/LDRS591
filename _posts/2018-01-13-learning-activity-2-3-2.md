The article is very current. It was received on May 10, 2016 and revised on June 4, 2017. It was accept on September 21, 2017 and published online on September 27, 2017.

<strong>Purpose</strong>

This article outlines the research method and process that the author used to collect evidence for the relationship between academic achievement and self-regulatory factors in a flipped classroom (Sun, Xie, &amp; Anderman, 2017, p. 49). This article discusses evidence-based results. There are no obvious biases in the language of the article.

<strong>Publication type/process</strong>

This article was published by Elsevier Inc. in their January 2018 copy of The Internet and Higher Education journal (The Internet and Higher Education, 2018). This article is peer-reviewed, as it is one of the requirements of being published in the journal (The Internet and Higher Education, 2018). The Internet and Higher Education is a reputable quarterly journal that addresses issues and developments related to online learning, teaching, and administration on the Internet (The Internet and Higher Education, 2018).

<strong>Biases/Special Interests</strong>

The authors discuss the limitations of the research and article (Sun et. al, 2018, p. 50). One of the main biases of this research was that the participants were undergraduate students enrolled in a calculus course in university (Sun et. al, 2018, p. 50). This means that these are generally highly academic students who chose to enroll in an academic, post-secondary mathematics course (Sun et. al, 2018, p. 50). As well, the authors acknowledge that the sample size of the research was not significantly large (Sun et. al, 2018, p. 50).

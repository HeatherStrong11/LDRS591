<strong>Servant Leadership: Its Origin, Development, and Application in Organizations</strong>

<strong>Is the study&#8217;s purpose clearly specified?</strong>

The article gives a clear purpose at the end of the introduction, stating &#8220;This paper explores the philosophical basis of servant leadership as conceptualized by Robert Greenleaf and as represented by historical figures such as Jesus Christ. The core construct of &#8216;servant leaders&#8217; will be drawn and examined&#8221; (Sendjaya &amp; Sarros, 2002, p. 57).

Rating: 3

<strong>Is the focus of the study appropriate? </strong>

The focus of the study is a single central phenomenon that is broad and encompassing. Multiple historical figures are implied but the focus is consistent.

Rating: 3

<strong>Is the overall intent of the study appropriate?</strong>

The intent is clear as it is to explore the central phenomenon. Again, it is a concise statement that encompasses what is to be learned within the article. It is presented clearly throughout the article.

Rating: 3

<strong>Are the participants and the sites appropriate?</strong>

The participants and sites are identified though the purpose statement implies a current element to the research which is lacking. Greenleaf and Jesus Christ are mentioned and a historical view of servant leadership is relayed. This question is difficult though as the article is an overview of the philosophical basis for servant leadership.

Rating: 2

<strong>Is the purpose of the study narrowed through appropriate research questions and/or hypotheses? </strong>

Some research questions are given but because the study is more of an overview of servant leadership, there may not have been a great need for research questions. However, it is clear the researchers have an openness to learning new things from historical figures they mention. I felt the article strayed slightly from its purpose in narrowing on charismatic leadership. At times, it felt as though the flow of the article was lacking.

Rating: 2

<strong>Does the purpose of the study follow logically from the statement of the problem and the literature review?</strong>

It is difficult to identify a &#8220;problem&#8221; in this article as it is an overview of the philosophical basis for servant leadership. That said, it seems that the article suggests more organizations should be using servant leadership as it has proven to be effective.

Rating: 1

<strong>Is the purpose consistent with the study&#8217;s overall approach?</strong>

The purpose is broad and does indeed emerge throughout the article. More could be done to assess the impact of servant leadership within organizations, thus a quantitative approach may have helped. Again, the article ends somewhat abruptly leaving future frameworks and research of servant leadership for someone else to complete. This article was written in 2002 and there was very little empirical research done on the topic.

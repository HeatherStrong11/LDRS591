<p>Date: this article was received on 26 Feb 2014, accepted  on 04 Dec 2014, and published online: 20 Apr 2015. Clearly, this is a relatively new journal article.</p>
<p>The authors are intended to observe the patients&#8217; creative acts during music therapy sessions within long-term psychiatric rehabilitation. In another word, the authors would like to test how music therapy is going to work on opening channels of communication, nurturing relationships, and helping the patients return to a balanced state. This article is closely related to one of my research questions: &#8220;how important is the role of music therapy playing in the process of psychological counselling?&#8221;. I want to explore my research question to offer a useful approach for psychological counsellors to adopt; raise hope for the patients and their families; and expand a different way of considering the methods for other researchers who are willing to devote to this kind of project. I believe all three categories of the readers are also the intended audience of the authors of this journal article.</p>
<p>This journal article was published by Routledge, which is the world&#8217;s leading academic publisher (&#8220;Routledge&#8221;). And the journal article was contained in Nordic Journal of Music Therapy (NJMT), which is a peer-reviewed journal published in collaboration with GAMUT (&#8220;Nordic Journal of Music Therapy&#8221;). It means this journal article was evidently peer reviewed.</p>
<p>The authors made a proclamation at the end of the article saying that they have no conflicts of interest in relation to this article. I believe that they have no biases after reviewing the entire content of the article by myself.</p>

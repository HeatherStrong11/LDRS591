I found that each of the authors of the articles posted conceptualizes evidence-based leadership in a slightly different way. The Patton article viewed evidence-based leadership as seeking the absolute best of “lessons learned”. When the best is sought out the more transferable and dependable the research is. The Trybus article looked at evidence-based leadership through an educational frame. In this case, evidence-based research was seen as high standard but also a necessity to achieve reliable and accurate information to help students. Lastly, the Walshe and Rundall article had a medical take on evidence-based leadership. From the clinical perspective,  not the healthcare management one, research is not only important to have but also to use properly as it is often applied incorrectly. In addition, having an environment in which research and evidence are supported and encouraged helps it flourish thereby helping those in the medical field give their patients the best treatment possible. In all of these cases, the evidence is being considered as reliable information that allows professionals in all fields to better serve others.

In my opinion, evidence-based leadership is important because it separates speculation from fact. Professionals can contemplate forever but unless there is factual proof that a certain thought-process produces the intended results then the process is pointless.

On another note, I believe research is not only the best place for professionals to learn but also beginners. For instance, as a teacher, whenever I have a student who has a rare medical condition the first place I go to is concrete research on the subject. This enables me to be a better leader because it gives me a more firm understanding of how to go about teaching a particular student whether it be adapting their work or finding new ways to scaffold their thought processes. In cases like these, however, I’m already in a leadership position. Which makes me wonder, should evidence-based research only be for experienced leaders? Or can it be for anyone on any level of experience in any field?

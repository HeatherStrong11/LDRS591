<p><strong>Servant leadership: its origin, development, and application in organization</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Does the review include relevant literature?</strong></p>
<p>The article, written in 2002, includes relevant literature. The writings of Greenleaf and Burns are both examined as well as more current writings such as that of Bass and Russel. It also references current studies showing the relationship between servant leadership and organizations.</p>
<p>Rating: 3</p>
<p><strong>Does the review examine sources that are recent and of high quality?</strong></p>
<p>The article uses peer-reviewed writings that are current, as well as some that are slightly dated. However, even those that are slightly dated are held in high respect, including those of Greenleaf and Burns.</p>
<p>Rating: 3</p>
<p><strong>Is the literature review documented properly?</strong></p>
<p>There is no formal literature review in the paper. The literature is cited and introduced within the article introduction. A formal literature review could have helped the article, though it was not necessary.</p>
<p>Rating: 2</p>
<p><strong>Is the literature thoughtfully synthesized?</strong></p>
<p>The literature used throughout is synthesized well in the beginning of the article. The article gives a brief overview of the origins of servant leadership and transformational leadership, condensing the basic philosophies of Greenleaf and Burns. References to other forms of leadership are given, though not expanded upon. A brief summary of popular leadership philosophies prior to servant leadership would have helped introduce the topic of servant leadership.</p>
<p>Rating: 2</p>
<p><strong>Is the literature critically examined?</strong></p>
<p>The article does not examine the literature critically. Rather, it provides an overview of the literature, highlighting its relevance to servant leadership.</p>
<p>Rating: 1</p>
<p><strong>Does the study have a strong foundation in the literature?</strong></p>
<p>The article builds upon the writings of Greenleaf particularly and traces servant leadership back to the teaches of Jesus. Previous literature is used as the starting point for the article and is quoted throughout. The article does well to begin with previous literature in order to give context to the rest of the article.</p>
<p>Rating: 3</p>
<p><strong>Does the literature fit the study&#8217;s overall approach?</strong></p>
<p>The literature used throughout is appropriate for the article, however, there is a lack of literature regarding the ongoing research of servant leadership. This is possibly the most lacking section of the article as it leaves the reader with questions unanswered. However, the literature that is used to describe servant leaderships&#8217; origins and application fits very well.</p>
<p>Rating: 3</p>
<p>Overall score: 17 (High Quality)</p>

<p>Dear LDRS 591 Learners,</p>
<p>We have come to the conclusion of our course together.  I can&#8217;t believe 10 weeks have already passed. I was very impressed by all of your responses this week to each of the learning activities.  This past week you had the opportunity to revisit a question about making informed decisions, discuss why evidence-based decision making is important for the Transformational Servant Leader, and reflect on your own expectations for a high quality research report.</p>
<p>Here are some of the highlights that I have learned from each of your posts this week:</p>
<p><strong>Will you make decisions differently now after taking this course?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;This course has shaped my decision-making and critique approaches in my workplace&#8221; (<a href="https://create.twu.ca/soleona/2018/03/05/ldrs591-unit-10-learning-activity-10-1/">So, 2018).</a></p>
<p>&#8220;It was insightful to learn about action research, since I can apply these tools at the workplace to suggest some possibilities to resolve problem and support and help others in deciding to solve a problem&#8221; (<a href="https://create.twu.ca/twuwafasiyam/learning-activity-10-1-unit-10/">Siyam, 2018).</a></p>
<p>&#8220;I can translate the knowledge I gained from action research unit and apply it to some practical problems at work&#8221; <a href="https://create.twu.ca/icandothis/2018/03/04/ldrs-591-activity-10-1/#comment-134">(Shergill, 2018).</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Although a leader may be influenced by past experiences, a leader should base their decision on current and present findings and facts, and not solely on past experiences&#8221; <a href="https://create.twu.ca/sadiethompson/2018/03/12/learning-activity-10-1/">(Thompson, 2018).</a></p>
<p>&#8220;I can now also assess the validity of a study by reading through the article and assessing the quality of each section. I am able to make more of my own judgement calls instead of relying on other factors such as publishing journal or academic affiliations&#8221; <a href="https://create.twu.ca/ruthleong/2018/03/04/learning-activity-10-1/">(Leong, 2018).</a></p>
<p>&#8220;The importance of evaluating the media sources and information I consume on a daily basis. The truth is we all tend to use information when we make decisions. It is therefore essential that information we are using as a tool in that process is both genuine and accurate&#8221; <a href="https://mrwilliamsphysed.wordpress.com/2018/03/06/unit-10-la1-bp1-2/">(Williams, 2018).</a></p>
<p>&#8220;I now have a deeper and richer understanding of the research process, and how it provides the foundations upon which evidence-based leadership can be actualized&#8221; <a href="https://create.twu.ca/lewa/2018/03/10/ldrs591-unit-10-learning-activity-10-1/">(Ahmed, 2018).</a></p>
<p>&#8220;LDRS 591 has not only provided tools but also allowed each one of us to apply them and witness how valuable they can be&#8221; <a href="https://create.twu.ca/furtherupfurtherin/2018/03/11/learning-activity-10-1/">(Linkletter, 2018).</a></p>
<p>&#8220;The most important thing I gained from this course is critical thinking. I have realized that critical thinking should be applied to not only reviewing articles but also decision making and other issues in work and life&#8221; <a href="https://create.twu.ca/layla11/2018/03/05/unit-10-learning-activity-10-1/">(Zhang, 2018).</a></p>
<p><strong>Do you think evidence-based decision making is important for the transformational servant leader?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Evidence-based decision making is crucial for the Transformational Servant leader because seeking truth and serving followers is inherent to Transformational Servant Leadership&#8221; <a href="https://create.twu.ca/soleona/2018/03/05/ldrs591-unit-10-activity-10-2/">(So, 2018)</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evidence-based decision -making helps the TSL make well-informed decisions by having the best available evidence and managed outcome&#8221; <a href="https://create.twu.ca/twuwafasiyam/learning-activity-10-2-unit-10/">(Siyam, 2018).</a></p>
<p>&#8220;A good “transformational servant leader” needs to be well versed in the research process and also its analysis. Even if one is not an active researcher, a good leader should know how to evaluate research so that they can find ways how to best apply it&#8221; <a href="https://create.twu.ca/icandothis/2018/03/04/ldrs-591-activity-10-2/">(Shergill, 2018).</a></p>
<p>&#8220;If the goal of a transformational servant leader is to put the interests of the follower at the heart of the decision-making process, then they need to earn the respect and the trust of the followers. If the leader’s decision-making is biased, then the follower will feel like his or her viewpoints are not being carefully examined&#8221; <a href="https://create.twu.ca/sadiethompson/2018/03/12/learning-activity-10-2/">(Thompson, 2018)</a></p>
<p>&#8220;When followers know that the leader has done his or her due diligence and researched all the implications of a decision, they will be more likely to put their trust in the leadership&#8221; <a href="https://create.twu.ca/ruthleong/2018/03/04/learning-activity-10-2/">(Leong, 2018).</a></p>
<p>&#8220;[Evidence] gives the leader foresight, which is essential in shaping followers and providing them with safe opportunities for learning and transformation&#8221; <a href="https://create.twu.ca/robtegelberg/2018/03/12/learning-activity-10-2-reflection-on-the-importance-of-evidence-based-research/">(Tegelberg, 2018).</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Having a curious mind and a willingness to seek out new ways of leading is essential for a transformational servant leader to continue to grow and mature&#8221; <a href="https://create.twu.ca/oplearning/2018/03/06/learning-activity-10-2/">(Parsons, 2018)</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Using evidence-based decision making helps choices be taken collectively instead of individually. This leads to higher accountability and less risk of unethical or poor behavioral decisions. Avoiding both is essential to modeling transformational and servant leadership effectively&#8221; <a href="https://mrwilliamsphysed.wordpress.com/2018/03/06/unit-10-la2-bp1/">(Williams, 2018).</a></p>
<p>&#8220;If your beliefs and decision are based on evidence, it will increase your credibility not only as a leader but also as a person. As a result, it will increase the trust others place in you, which will improve your influence and ability to lead effectively&#8221; <a href="https://create.twu.ca/furtherupfurtherin/2018/03/11/learning-activity-10-2/">(Linkletter, 2018).</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Without evidence-based leadership, it is safe to assume that sooner or later our credibility will disintegrate. &#8220;Presenting [information] alongside evidence to my superiors, it not only looks more professional but is persuasive from a business standpoint as well&#8221; <a href="https://create.twu.ca/jlkeith/learning-activity-10-2/">(Keith, 2018).</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Good leaders are always willing to see difficult situations as opportunities&#8221; <a href="https://create.twu.ca/jlkeith/learning-activity-10-2/">(Keith, 2018).</a></p>
<p><strong>My Final Thoughts:</strong></p>
<p>I want to conclude by providing a few final thoughts as you continue on your leadership journey in the MA Lead program. First, remember that <b>leadership learning is a slow, careful process </b>(Kellerman, 2012).  Second,<b> leadership learning should be approached holistically and in a way that connects to life broadly</b>. This means that the relationships that you foster in your workplace right now provide a great venue to practice the leadership skills you are learning.  Third, <b>leading and following are inextricably intertwined</b>. That is why Sergiovanni contends that the best leader is a super-follower (Sergiovanni, 1992).  Finally, mistakes and &#8220;<strong>failures can become our most powerful path to learning</strong> if we are willing to choose courage over comfort&#8221; <a href="https://brenebrown.com/blog/2018/03/13/courage-comfort-rumbling-shame-accountability-failure-work/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=bb_heartbeat&amp;utm_content=031318">(Brown, 2015).</a></p>
<p>It has been a pleasure to teach all of you online over these past 10 weeks.  I look forward to hearing about your journey ahead as you progress throughout the MA Lead Program.</p>
<p>Best Wishes,</p>
<p>Dr. Heather Strong</p>

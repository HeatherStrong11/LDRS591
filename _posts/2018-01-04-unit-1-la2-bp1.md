<strong>What factors do you</strong> <strong>think shape your decision-making process as a leader?</strong>

I believe my process differs significantly depending on the nature of the decision being made. The lower the significance of the decision the more likely I am to depend on experience and or values to shape a decision quickly. If it requires more thought or evaluation, I often find myself pursuing policy statements or handbooks from my company. If I determine the decision is highly sensitive and likely to provoke some form of negative response from a stakeholder, e.g., parents or colleague, then I will seek a more senior colleagues opinion and or experience.

<strong>Do you agree or disagree with the proposition made in the course notes (by the authors) that one’s worldview influences the types of questions that you ask and the processes that you use to find the answers to your questions?</strong>

I&#8217;m not sure if my worldview influences the types of questions I ask or how I find my answers. I would suggest that my worldview has more impact on the way I consume, evaluate and cognitively process the information. I relate to the three foundational questions reasonably regularly as part of this analysis.

What is real? What is true? What is good?

Especially in current world affairs, I find peace in the knowledge that I have faith in a God who is real, true and good. Although I may not agree with the current #FAKENEWS trend, I do believe its impact has been two-fold. Either it has made people bunker down into one source of news as the real and true source of information. Or it has awakened people to start critically analyzing and deliberate on information being processed and consumed.

<strong>Question</strong>

What sources do you regularly use for finding world news? What made you choose this source?

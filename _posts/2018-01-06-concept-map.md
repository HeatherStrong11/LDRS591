I often wonder how can I optimize my time to get the most out of my day? How can I find time for the activities I like doing for myself , while balancing my family and work responsibilities?  As per Trochim (2001), concept mapping is &#8220;general method that can be used to help any individual or group to describe their ideas about some topic in a pictorial form&#8221;. In this assignment our topic was &#8216;Me&#8217;. I found that talking about myself in concrete terms was not easy. I know the vague &#8216;me&#8217;, but putting myself down in the form of a &#8216;concept map&#8217;, and then formulating questions about things that are important to me, was a totally new concept.

The following questions arose , in no particular sequence of importance:

<ol>
<li>What is the optimal time one should spend working from home , if at all ? What proportion of one&#8217;s work day is reasonable to be spent commuting to and from work? Of course, the ideal would be to live next to work, but we all know what is more often than not impossible.</li>
<li>For me time spent with family is important for my emotional well being. Some days, there is a conflict between my desire to do some activities that are centered around me, and not the family. What is the optimum &#8216;me&#8217; time that a person requires per day. Does it have to be everyday, or is a big chunk of time at the end of the week an adequate substitute ?</li>
<li>Balanced diet and exercise are universally accepted to be the 2 most important factors in helping one maintain their health. I have recently been wondering if there is a possible change in the relative importance of these 2 as one grows older ? I have definitely noticed that I need to exercise more to keep my weight in check.</li>
<li>How does one factor in mental health in the overall personal satisfaction/happiness scale ?</li>
</ol>

The one prominent question to me out of these is the one about mental health and happiness. We may call it satisfaction.  I wonder if there are any validated and researched tools out there that can objectively measure one&#8217;s happiness/ satisfaction, and the factors that contribute to it ? Or if this idea of happiness is purely subjective, and immeasurable? What is the impact of happiness/satisfaction on one&#8217;s overall health? Are there cultural differences in the importance given to individual components of the formula to happiness?To find answers to this question I would be looking at literature in the fields of psychology, psychiatry, health and fitness, and maybe spirituality.

<p>As far as servant-based leadership goes, I think being able to make good decisions with evidence is an absolute necessity. It is important because it enables us to better serve others and allows people to feel they can trust us. As the common saying goes, knowledge is wisdom.</p>
<p>When we collect solid data we make ourselves more aware of our surroundings and we can feel confident in our decisions. Just relying on our gut feelings and/or worldview isn’t enough. As Proverbs 27:17 says, “As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another”. Within the context of this course, this means we should look to others research and findings to better ourselves and further everyone&#8217;s knowledge in general.</p>
<p>People seek out dependable leadership. Anyone can second guess a leader, and rightly so. Just as we as students should scrutinize our sources so to should people challenge their leaders. Good leaders are always willing to see difficult situations as opportunities, “Do not treat prophecies with contempt, but test them all; hold on to what is good” (1 Thessalonians 5: 20-21).</p>
<p>Without evidence-based leadership, it is safe to assume that sooner or later our credibility will disintegrate. Morals, religion, and perspective differ from person to person. So to argue that an opinion is a fact without solid evidence only discredits someone even more. Even in situations where evidence is not needed it still increases peace of mind in any field and/or situation. An example of this would be the scenario from my action plan research project. I really shouldn’t have to have evidence to prove that workers need motivation. It seems common sense. But when presented alongside evidence to my superiors, it not only looks more professional but is persuasive from a business standpoint as well.</p>

<strong>What sampling strategy is used and is it appropriate and justified?</strong>

The authors do not identify what sampling strategy is used. However, according to Plano-Clark and Creswell, describe the intent of theory or concept sampling is, “to generate a theory or explore a concept.” (2015, p. 334) They explain the characteristics as, “the researcher&#8217;s samples individuals or sites because they can help the researcher generate or discover a theory or specific concepts within the theory.” (2015, p. 334) Although not directly stated, it seems Chan &amp; So used and were justified in using theory or concept samplings in their study.

<strong>Is the sample size appropriate?</strong>

Although there are no strict rules regarding sample sizes and qualitative studies, Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell suggest 20 to 30 participants in a grounded theory study. As a result, Chan &amp; So have fewer participants than the general rule. (2015, p. 336)

<strong>Is the data collected appropriately?</strong>

Yes, focus group interviews are an appropriate means to collect data in a grounded theory study. The size of the focus groups used was also appropriate. Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell suggest the use of focus groups when participants are of adolescent age as they are more likely to feel comfortable, talk openly, and think more deeply about the topic when they can listen to their peers. (2015, p. 339)

<strong>Are the data gathered ethically and thoughtfully?</strong>

Yes, before each focus group interview the participants, “gave their written consent, acknowledging their understanding of the research, agreeing to participate in the interview and giving permission for the audio recording.” (Chan &amp; So, 2017, p. 21)

I would give the researchers a 2/3 for the analysis process. They did record the interviews and took into account personal interpretation. In fact, answers to the questions by the participants were given from experience. However, I am unable to find evidence of codes for the data.  Concerning the descriptors, I would give a 3/3 in this category. While the text does say that it must be done with rich detail and participant quotes I found the explanation to be sufficient. The interviews were given to students at an international school in Hong Kong.

I would give a 2.5/3 for both the researcherâ€™s findings having appropriate themes about the central phenomenon and having an excellent exploration of said phenomenons. I subtracted half a point because I think there could have been more perspective. They did say that research in the area of servant leadership in regards to secondary students was lacking. They also explained that this area was of great importance because secondary students are going through a significant amount of change. Still, I wish they would have acknowledged possible arguments made from the other side. Perhaps there are those who believe that servant leadership research in the area of secondary students is pointless because they are changing so rapidly. Everyone in the secondary level is at a different stage of development, and so it goes without saying that perhaps servant leadership research would be best done once the temperamental stages are over.

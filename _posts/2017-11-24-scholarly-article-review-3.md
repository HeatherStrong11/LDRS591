### Scholarly Article Review

In this assignment, you will write a critique of a journal article using the guideline provided below.

This assignment should be written in APA formatting style. Please use your APA manual for details about structure and content, clear and concise writing, the mechanics of style, and crediting sources.

This assignment may be a maximum of 3-4 pages in length. Note that this is rather brief, requiring you to synthesize a lot of information in a concise way, which can be challenging at first. Writing drafts of each section and then editing these to consolidate information is recommended.

##### **STEP 1** 

Select a published, peer-reviewed journal article of your choice and provide the reference for this article in APA format at the top of the page.

##### **STEP 2**

Summarize the article you selected by answering each of the following questions:

1. What are the key research questions being addressed?
2. Are these questions based on, or related to, previous theory or research?
3. What are \(if any\) the specific study hypotheses?
4. Provide a brief overview of the participant sample, including age, sex, any distinguishing features of the sample, and how the participants were recruited.
5. Describe briefly the procedures of the study, including what kind of design was used, what methods/measures were used, and in general “how” the subjects were “studied.”
6. Summarize the important findings and explain how they support or don’t support the hypotheses.

##### **STEP 3** 

Discuss the study with a critical eye for both its strengths and its weaknesses. Consider the following questions in your discussion:

1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of this study? Include both what the authors tell you and your own thoughts.
2. Does the abstract accurately summarize the article?
3. Does the purpose statement in the abstract match the purpose statement in the introduction?
4. Is all of the information in the introduction organized well?
5. Does the information presented in the introduction allow you to grasp "the problem" under investigation and provide a "broad context" for the problem? 
6. Is there a review of precedent literature on the topic and does the introduction lead coherently to the purpose of the study?
7. Do you think the methods are appropriate for studying the problem?  Explain your reasoning.
8. Do you think the study could be duplicated from the information provided in the methods section?
9. Is the sequence of the methods section clear?
10. Review the results in light of the purpose of the study.  Do the results reveal what the researcher intended?
11. Does the discussion just repeat the results or does the author\(s\) interpret the meaning of the results?
12. Is the author's interpretation supported \(or backed up\) by other research?
13. Are there limitations identified?
14. Are there suggestions for future research? 

##### **STEP 4**

Speculate on how you might expand upon this research based upon the limitations you have identified. This can be general or specific. That said, a sweeping statement such as “I would like to study this phenomenon more” doesn’t help us to understand why that might be an acceptable new direction without including sufficient justification for your claims. Thus, concrete ideas about your rationale are expected in this section, although explicit details regarding the next study or series of studies are not crucial.

##### **STEP 5**

APA formatting is required for this assignment.  Please refer to the APA formatting requirments and APA rubric for further information.

##### **STEP 6**

Submit a draft of your assignment for peer review to your assigned partner via email.  Please submit the draft at least one week before the due date to allow for feedback and revisions.  Your partner will review your assignment and provide you with feedback following the peer review protocol.  Submit your assignment, along with the feedback that you received from your partner with a brief rationale for the changes that you made or didn't make.  Please submit this assignment using the Assignment 2 drop box on the learning management system.

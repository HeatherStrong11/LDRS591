Rosencrans, Kendra. December 2014. <em>Nurturing Faith for Action: Theological Education and Global Responsibility. </em>

<strong>Who is the author? What are the author&#8217;s credentials?</strong>

Kendra Rosencrans is the author. She has a Masters degree in Science Journalism from Columbia University and is a Ph.D. candidate in Organizational Systems at Saybrook University. She is the co-editor of a special issue of the Journal of Organizational Transformation and Social Change.

<strong>Is the source up to date? </strong>

The article was written late in 2014. Therefore, while it is a few years old now, it speaks to economic issues that we still face today. Some of the article focuses on the oil industry, which is information that could be updated. However, the last half of her article focuses on Christian economics and ethics which is still a very relevant topic.

<strong>What are the intentions of the author? Who is the intended audience?</strong>

The author intends to make a connection between faith and our business and consumer practices. She uses the phrase &#8220;whole-world ethic of well-being&#8221; to describe how Christians should make decisions regarding consumption and business practice. The intended audience are church and business leaders, as well as Christian scholars and educators.

<strong>Publication type/process &#8211; Who published the article? Was it peer-reviewed? </strong>

The article was published by Wiley-Blackwell out of the UK. It was peer-reviewed.

<strong>Are there any obvious biases and/or special interests that the author acknowledges? </strong>

The only bias the author has is her Christian worldview. However, this is to be assumed given the title and introduction of the article. She writes from a perspective that all people and all creation is meaningful because God has made it all.

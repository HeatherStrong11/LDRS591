The following is my evaluation of the qualitative research design in the study by Russell, Maxfield, &amp; Russell, (2017). I performed the evaluation by applying criteria provided by Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015, p. 301).

<h5> <strong>A research design guided the conduct of the qualitative study? </strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

Absolutely. The key sections of the study, notably, the purpose, and methods, show that a grounded theory research design was used. In furtherance of this, the researchers also provided evidence that the study was built around up-to-date literature; they explained that “this study builds upon the conceptual work of Russell (2016) who argued the existence of an ongoing tangible and intangible benefit cycle between leader and follower.” (Russell, Maxfield, &amp; Russel, 2017, p. 76).

<strong> </strong>

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>What research design was used to guide the study and was it justified? </strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

A grounded theory research design was used to guide the study. This is evident from the key procedures used in the study. These procedures were; (a) data collection from multiple participants, all having different experiences with servant leadership (Russell, et al., 2017, p. 85), and (b) data analysis using open, axial and selective coding methods (Russel et al., 2017, p. 86). The results of the study also described the categories of data found and their relationships to one another in the context of the theory being developed (Russel, et al., 2017, pp. 86-92).

I felt the research design was justified because the key procedures identified above, are appropriate for the purpose of the study which entails generating a theory that describes the self-interest of servant leaders.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>Good qualitative data collection procedures were used</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 2/3</strong>

Although the data collection procedure used in the study involved participants who had different experiences relevant to the theory being developed (Russell, et al., 2017, p. 85), the researchers made use of multiple questionnaires in gathering data. This was a violation of the evaluation criteria which suggests that data collection in a study as this, should be done using interviews.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Good qualitative data analysis procedures were used</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

Absolutely! The researchers analysed data using three stages of data analysis; open coding, axial coding, and selective coding. (Russel et al., 2017, p. 86) which are appropriate for a study as this.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Good qualitative results and interpretations were reported</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

Again, the results of the study described the categories of data found and their relationships to one another in the context of the theory being developed (Russell, et al., 2017, pp. 86-92). This was in line with the evaluation criteria, which states that the results in a grounded theory should describe the categories found in the data.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>The study used a rigorous research design</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

The researchers described the problem, research questions, purpose, and methods in a logical, consistent, and exploratory manner.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>The use of the qualitative research design addressed the study’s purpose</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

Absolutely! A study that seeks to generate a theory should make use of a grounded theory research design.

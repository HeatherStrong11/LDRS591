<h3>Narrowing your Research Topic</h3>

I have made my way through all of your first assignments and have emailed each of you with feedback and a grade.  I am impressed at how diverse and interesting each topic is.  In all of the assignments my comment has been &#8220;Great topic, very interesting idea, now all you need to do is narrow your topic so that it is manageable to work with.&#8221;  Perhaps after some of the learning activities this week you have realized that your topic is too broad or too specific and you are not getting the results you are looking for.  In this post, I want to help you figure out how you can narrow down your research topic into something that will be manageable to write about.

I want to begin by telling you a little about my own research journey and then I will give you some practical tips to help you on your way.  In my undergraduate degree I studied two majors: psychology (the study of the mind) and kinesiology (the study of the body and movement).  In the final year of my undergrad I took the most fascinating course called the Psychology of Health and Well-being.  I was very interested in the topics that we studied in this course because it was the perfect pairing of my two chosen majors &#8211; the mind and the body.  One particular topic captured my attention and I was unable to let go of my interest in it.  The topic was female athletes and eating disorders.  This topic interested me for many reasons, but I was particularly interested in the impact that disordered eating (both physically and psychologically) had on the performance of females athletes.  At the end of my four year degree, I decided my education needed to continue into graduate work so that I could continue exploring my interest in this topic.

As I entered my Master&#8217;s my focus was still on the topic of understanding eating disorders, but the population that I was interested in &#8211; female athletes with eating disorders &#8211; was a difficult and challenging group to study.  So I needed to make some adaptations to the research that I wanted to pursue in order to make my thesis project more manageable.  I will save you all the details of the 2-year journey of learning what works and what doesn&#8217;t when you are studying a clinical population, but what I ended up with was a very different thesis project then what I had originally intended.

The topic I ended up studying was the differences between women with eating disorders, at-risk for eating disorders, and those not at-risk on a very specific psychological construct which is called self-presentation motivation.  Self-presentation motivation reflects the process that we go through in an attempt to monitor and control the impression we make on others (Schlenker &amp; Leary, 1982).  For example, when we go for a job interview we usually wear nice clothes, get a hair cut, rehearse interview questions because we want to make a good impression on a potential employer.  Now self-presentation motivation in itself is not a single construct that can be empirically measured.  In my study this concept was measured using several different questionnaires and they were a) fear of negative evaluation (when a person is fearful of receiving disapproval and criticism from others; Leary, 1983), b) public self-consciousness (the awareness or sensitivity a person experiences from the opinions of others; Fenigstein, Scheier, &amp; Buss, 1975), c) social physique anxiety (the anxiety experienced when your body is being evaluated by others; Hart, Rejeski, &amp; Leary, 1989), and d) self-presentational efficacy (the probability of conveying a desired impression on others; Leary &amp; Atherton, 1986).  If you are interested in reading more about this study you can find the published article here <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471015306000122">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471015306000122</a>

This is what my research topic started as: <em><strong>How do eating disorders impact the performance of female athletes?</strong></em>

What my research question ended up as: <em><strong>What are the differences in self-presentation motivation across three groups which have known differences on measures of eating disordered behaviour?</strong></em>

Sometimes the topic we start out with is not the one we end up studying.  This was certainly true in my case.

In light of the challenges that you may face as you try to narrow down your research topic into a manageable research question and even further into search terms, I have found a really helpful tool to help you identify your research question.   This tool was originally published in Booth, Colomb, &amp; Williams (2008) and was adapted by <em>The Step-by-Step Guide &amp; Research Rescue: Finding and Narrowing Your Topic</em> (2017). Retrieved from <a href="http://guides.lib.byu.edu/c.php?g=216340&amp;p=1428396">http://guides.lib.byu.edu/c.php?g=216340&amp;p=1428396</a>

If you can fill out this table, you most likely have a narrow enough topic with enough direction to perform some great research.

<strong>1)  I am researching </strong>______________________________________ (<strong>topic</strong>)

<strong>2)  because I want to find out </strong>______________________________(<strong>issue/question</strong>)

<strong>3)  in order to </strong>________________________________ (<strong>application </strong>&#8211; So What? &#8211; Project/Audience/Purpose driven)

Here is my research example using the three step process:

I am researching <b>self-presentation motivation and eating disorders in women</b> (topic)<br />
because I want to find out <strong>if there is a difference in self-presentation motives among women with an eating disorder, at-risk for an eating disorder, and not at-risk for an eating disorder</strong> (issue/question)<br />
in order to <strong>enhance our understanding of the eating disordered population as well as provide insight into the self-presentational motives across known groups.  </strong>(application &#8211; <em>audience</em>).

It looks like everyone is well on their way!  If you need further help with your research question do not hesitate to contact me.  I am here to help!

<h3>Additional sources for finding scholarly literature:</h3>

I also wanted to mention two other sources of information that you can use to gather information on your research topic.  The first suggestion is viewing the TED talk videos.  These videos are a great resource to help you become familiar with a researcher and their work on a specific topic.  You can search almost any topic on the TED website, the videos are usually under 20 minutes, and are very good.  You can find TED site here: <a href="https://www.ted.com/">https://www.ted.com</a>

The second resource is using the reference lists at the back of a book or of a journal article on your topic.  These are both great places to find additional sources of information on your topic and also help you become familiar with who is publishing information in your area of interest.

Great work this week!

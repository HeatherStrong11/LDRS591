<p>Hunter, E.M., Neubert, M. J., Perry. S.J., Witt, L.A., Penny, L.M., &amp; Weinberger, E. (2013). Servant leaders inspire servant followers: Antecedents and outcomes for employees and the organization. <em>Leadership Quarterly, 24(2)</em>, 316-331.</p>
<p><strong>Is the topic interesting?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, for those that desire to lead, an article that discusses leadership ought to be of interest.</p>
<p>2/3</p>
<p><strong>Is there a meaningful problem?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, understanding how servant leadership influences outcomes at different levels of an organization could provide mangers valuable information on how to apply principles of servant leadership.</p>
<p>2/3</p>
<p><strong>Is the importance of the problem justified?</strong></p>
<p>The researchers review the previous literature and identify the lack of research on the application of servant leadership and provide arguments on why they feel it is necessary.</p>
<p>2/3</p>
<p><strong>Are there deficiencies in the knowledge about the problem?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>2/3</p>
<p><strong>Is an audience identified and are there specific examples of how the audiences can use the missing knowledge?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, they briefly mention how the study would benefit scholars and managers. They could have been more specific.</p>
<p>2/3</p>
<p><strong>Does the passage clearly argue that the study is warranted?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, but I am not convinced the study will find anything we don’t all ready know – servant leadership creates a positive influence, a climate of care, support, and trust, one should not be surprised that employees would be motivated and less likely want to leave in such an environment.</p>
<p>1/3</p>
<p><strong>Is the passage well written?</strong></p>
<p>It was not terrible, but it was not great. To be honest, I was somewhat bored and struggled to get through it, but that might be a reflection of myself and not the authors and their writing.</p>
<p>2/3</p>
<p>Total 13/21 – Adequate quality.</p>

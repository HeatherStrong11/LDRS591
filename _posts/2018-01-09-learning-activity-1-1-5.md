<span style="margin: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">For as long as I can remember I have not only relied on research but thoroughly enjoyed the process. “Research” was at the forefront as I studied philosophy and history in my undergrad and as I completed my bachelor of education. </span></span>

<span style="margin: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">In my professional life as a teacher, a student, and lifelong learner research coupled with my worldview provide the necessary foundation, tools, and knowledge to navigate the complex and challenging field of education effectively.</span></span>

<span style="margin: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">In my personal life, as a husband and a father to two German Shepherds research is paramount as I seek to be a faithful servant of God, and provide for my family. The ability to locate, identify and decipher between good and bad information is vital, regardless if one is buying a new phone, vehicle, or home, or drafting their fantasy keeper league. </span></span>

<span style="margin: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Research is necessary for all aspects of one’s life.</span></span>

<span style="margin: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">As a teacher and a leader within my school community, I have the privilege to not only influence the students in my class but also influence school-wide policy. Many of our students suffer a great deal of trauma. As a result, many of them exhibit severe social, emotional, and behaviour issues. As a Christian, my worldview confirms the inherent value of everyone, regardless of their age or ability because everybody was created in the image of God. This belief has allowed me to see the potential in all students which motivates me to create an effective school-wide policy that will support the growth of all students. Through personal experience, reading numerous research studies on trauma victims, and relying on the opinion of experts we are in the process of creating a policy of grace. We desire to create the necessary environment that will allow the growth of an authentic relationship between students and staff that will begin the healing process. </span></span>

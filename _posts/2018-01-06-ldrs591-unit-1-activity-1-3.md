Patton (2001) discusses the difference between the popular use of anecdotal learning lessons from  &#8220;research and theory&#8221; (p.332) based lessons. Patton (2001) states that evidence-based lessons and leadership is best practice as they &#8220;reduce uncertanity, offer illumination, elighten funders and staff [&#8230;], enhance communications, and facilitate sharing of perceptions&#8221; (p.332). This is contrasted with popular ideas that lose &#8220;its substance and meaning&#8221; (p. 333) due to essons not derived from research but anecdotal experiences. The quality of the practice or lesson can be measured by &#8220;one&#8217;s confidence in the transferability [&#8230;] of a supposed lesson learned&#8221; (p.334).

Trybus (2007) discusses the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act&#8217;s mandate of requiring educators in the U.S. to only teach curriculum backed by Scientifically Based Research (SBR). This is fueled by constant pressures to improve programs. Acceptable evidence to these leaders, or educators, follow the mold of traditional scientific disciplines &#8211; empiricism, data analyses, and peer scientific review (p.5). The components of acceptable research studies are outlined clearly by the NCLB(p.6), and pre-judged bodies of scientific knowledge were created for educators. In the past, &#8220;professional wisdom&#8221; was the dominant compass for making teaching decisions (p.8). By integrating said wisdom with SBR evidence, it is the hope of educators that more nuanced solutions will come about and encourage teachers to feel they are &#8220;part of the process&#8221; while strengthening the education field as a whole (p.8).

Walshe and Rundall (2001) discuss the rise of evidence-based solutions that close an important gap between research and clinical practice (p.430). They present various examples of what happens when evidence-based doesn&#8217;t make it to clinical practice, leading to certain interventions being overused , underused, and misuse (p.431). Agencies in various countries established databases and &#8220;evidence-based practice centers to produce and disseminate evidence reports and technology assessments&#8221; (p.434). Along with these agencies, t<span style="font-size: 1rem">he Center for Health Management Research (CHMR) was established to bridge the differing ideas of how to apply the research in practice (p.440-446). It accomplishes this by building an evidence-based culture by drawing upon a common body of research and designing research questions that help health care organizations make decisions (p.446-449).</span>

As the authors discussed, good leadership depends on sound research, or evidence. <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/evidence?s=t">Dictionary.com</a> defines evidence as &#8220;that which tends to prove or disprove something.&#8221; The information an organization chooses to use must be proven. Beyond the importance of best practices, practicing well in the health sector, and educating students with facts, evidence-based decision-making is crucial because truth is important to society. If individuals or organizations made decisions based on personal understandings or experience, there would be no true understanding of what is good and what is real. There is a moral obligation for organizations and people to research and disseminate truth.

Where have you witnessed the negative outcome of misinformation, and what were the results?

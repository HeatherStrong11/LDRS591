Chaudhuri, Kettunen, and Naskar (2015) illustrate that transformational leadership focuses on how the past experience would influence the actions of the future through innovative ideas and views; and servant leadership emphasizes collective power, collaboration and the empowerment of followers. Furthermore, transformational servant leadership is defined as “the ability to cast a collaborative moral vision while actively caring for those participating in moving the vision to reality” (Parolini, 2012, p. 13). As far as I am concerned, a leader who is embedded in transformational servant leadership style would consciously collaborate and care about his staff at the same time. In order to implement the vision, a transformational servant leader would carefully communicate and guide the staff to make it come true. Parolini (2012) also states that the transformational servant leader will not grasp an opportunity just because it makes him or her instantly feel good. On the contrary, when a transformational servant leader is making decisions, more aspects and different perspectives should be taken into consideration.

Based on what I learned from this course, the evidence-based practice encompasses critical thinking, rigorous evaluation, academic researches, and well-thought-out procedures. In addition, when evidence-based practice is applied to decision making, the various perspectives matter a lot. Apparently, all the features of evidence-based practice resonate with the essential needs of the transformational servant leadership. In order to make the decision more comprehensive, first, a transformational servant leader would collaborate his staff&#8217;s ideas; second, the leader would communicate thoroughly with each of them to see their real thoughts and potential needs; third, combining all kinds of perspectives, the transformational servant leader would cultivate a common belief towards both the staff and the organization and completely support personal integration to fulfill the goals (Chaudhuri, Kettunen, &amp; Naskar, 2015). The evidence-based practice could help the leader find sound evidence (such as academic evidence) serving as the theoretical basis for the decision before collaborating the staff&#8217;s ideas. Then, the rigorous evaluation and critical thinking could help the leader better analyze the personal needs of the staff in the decision-making process. Furthermore, the various perspectives, which are emphasized in evidence-based practice, play a significant role in decision making of transformational servant leadership as well. After all, the decision made by a transformational servant leader will be aiming at serving both the staff and the organization eventually. The evidence-based decision would be not only rigorous and logical but also thoughtful and mature.

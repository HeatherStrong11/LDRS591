l will evaluate E. Russell, Maxfield, and J. Russell&#8217;s (2017) study based on Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell&#8217;s (2015) seven criteria for evaluating the research design of a qualitative research report (p.  301).

<ol>
<li><strong>A research design guides the conduct of the qualitative study (3/3) &#8211;  </strong>Russell et al. (2017) use the qualitative grounded theory &#8220;to discover how senior level leaders perceive personal benefits derived from serving the needs of their followers&#8221; (p. 75); this study researched the action of perceiving personal benefits through online questionnaires that questioned 14 senior level leaders. As the grounded theory approach seeks to explain &#8220;a process, action, or interaction [&#8230;.] built from the experiences and perspectives of participants,&#8221; Russell et al. (2017) seems knowledgeable about the design and use accurate terms to describe the grounded theory process.</li>
<li><strong>The choice of the research design is appropriate  and justified (3/3) &#8211; </strong>Russell et al. (2017) justify their choice of using the qualitative grounded theory by stating: &#8220;The design allows for an analysis of data using a constant <a href="http://polisci.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/people/u3827/APSA-TheComparativeMethod.pdf">comparative method</a>&#8221; (p. 84). Beyond this reasoning, the nature of the study that considers the experience of its participants&#8217; interpretation of their personal benefits derived from serving followers requires personal assessments of leaders &#8220;who have experienced the process&#8221; (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 298) that the grounded theory offers.</li>
<li><strong>Good qualitative data collection procedures are used (2/3) &#8211; </strong>Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015) state, &#8220;You often find that the grounded theory researcher interviewed people&#8221; (p. 298). While Russell et al. (2017) do not interview their participants directly, they choose to collect their participants&#8217; experience and perspectives through online questionnaires to protect their anonymity which equally serves the study&#8217;s purpose. The researchers ran a pilot study to refine the questions, and &#8220;established a secure database for data collection and storage to ensure data reliability&#8221; (p. 85).</li>
<li><strong>Good qualitative analysis procedures are used (3/3) &#8211; </strong>A good grounded research analyses &#8220;data using multiple stages of coding&#8221; (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 298). Russell et al. (2017) adhere to this characteristic by using &#8220;a tiered process for the sorting and analysis of the data&#8221; (p. 86) which included open codes and axial codes.</li>
<li><strong>Good qualitative results and interpretations are reported (3/3) &#8211; </strong>The results are organized well into two categories (or attributes) and a sample of the questionnaire answers are presented to support the two attributes. Overall, the conclusion and discussion of the data interpret the generated theory that leaders benefits from serving followers.</li>
<li><strong>The study used a rigorous research design (3/3) &#8211; </strong>The study&#8217;s process and analysis fit together logically and coherently. The article begins with a clear framework of the characteristics of servant leadership, and explore its research question thoroughly.</li>
<li><strong>The use of the qualitative research design addressed the study&#8217;s purpose (3/3) &#8211; </strong>The research design fits the study&#8217;s intent and answers the study&#8217;s intent of understanding how senior leadership perceives personal benefits of serving their followers; &#8220;leaders realize personal benefits from serving the needs of followers&#8221; (Russel et al., 2015, p. 92).</li>

<p><strong>Article</strong></p>
<p>The relationship between the servant leadership behaviors of immediate supervisors and follower’s perceptions of being empowered in the context of small business.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>1. The sampling strategy is appropriate and justified.</p>
<p><strong>Rate</strong></p>
<p>2=Good</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) The study uses a non-probability sampling strategy for explicitly stating that a combined purposive and snowball sampling method is used.</p>
<p>b) The authors do not provide the reasons for using this sampling strategy. However, as a correlational design, the sampling strategy is implicitly understandable.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>2. The sample size is appropriate and justified.</p>
<p><strong>Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) As a correlational study, the participants are 116 individuals.</p>
<p>b) The sample size is much larger than the minimum size (30 participants) for a correlational design.</p>
<p>c) The authors have done their best to reduce the chance of sampling error by selecting as many possible participants as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>3. High quality instruments are used to gather data.</p>
<p><strong>Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) The authors use two instruments to collect the data: the Essential Servant Leadership Behaviors (ESLB) and the Conditions of Work Effectiveness Questionnaire II (CWEQ II).</p>
<p>b) The ESLB instrument measuring the independent variable is the behavioral observation checklists type of instruments; The CWEQ II instrument measuring the dependent variable is the attitudinal measures type of instruments.</p>
<p>c) The ESLB instrument contains 10 clear questions and returns a Cronbach alpha of .90 indicating a high internal reliability; the CWEQ II instrument consists of 19 questions divided across six subscales and returns Cronbach alphas of .77, .67, .86, .77, .62, and .76 respectively, which indicate a strong internal reliability and consistency.</p>
<p>d) The authors include many citations to the literature indicating that the instruments are previously developed and used for research purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>4. The data are gathered using ethical quantitative procedures.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem">Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) The researchers obtain consent from participants because the individuals are willing to take the survey.</p>
<p>b) One group of the participants are adult business students recruited from a specific Californian college, and the permission is granted by the college.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>5. The data are gathered using standardized quantitative procedures.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem">Rate</strong></p>
<p>2=Good</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) The two instruments include closed-ended questions that have preset response options so that all participants use the same standard set of options for their responses (definitely no, no, neutral, yes, and definitely yes).</p>
<p>b) There is no information of the training raters to ensure that all participants completed the instruments in similar conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>6. The study has a high level of internal validity.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem">Rate</strong></p>
<p>0=Poor</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) This study is not any type of experiments, it is a correlational one.</p>
<p>b) The procedures in this study is not to test whether the independent variable causes an effect in dependent variables</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>7. The study has a high level of external validity.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem">Rate</strong></p>
<p>2=Good</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>The researchers select a convenience sample, obtain a sample size that is large considering the type of design, use procedures to encourage as many participants as possible, and obtain a relatively high rate of response from participants (130 out of 156 response).</p>
<p><strong>Total Score = 15 (11-16 = Adequate quality)</strong></p>

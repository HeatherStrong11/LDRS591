<p>In the notions of “lesson learned,” Patton. M (2001), he emphasizes the idea as “Lessons learned with only one type of supporting evidence would be considered lessons learned hypothesis.” Lessons learned should be the actual cases of practical wisdom, and evaluation the findings have been drawn. A critical principle her is to maintain the contextual frame.</p>
<p>A new term, “Evidence-based Education by (Whitehurst, as cited by Trybus, 2007) defined as “The integration of professional wisdom with the best available empirical evidence in making decisions about how to deliver instructions.” And also conclude the need for balance between both. Therefore, leaders will not be guided by evidence, but also will inform with results. Moreover, decision makers cannot assume that followers will be committed to a decision without being part of the process associated with concluding. I included the culture has an impact on the decision-making process, and she explicit that the decision has to grow with the culture of the organization. (organizational culture)</p>
<p>In this sense, Walsh and Rundall (2001) emphasize that the healthcare professionals use evidence-based practice supported by decision- support systems in their practice, and he included the idea of using evidence-based health care to challenge the way the decision made.  Also, referred to applying the concepts of evidence-based practice in healthcare management through collaboration, which create venues to be considered. However, the leaders and managers of healthcare organizations, while often doing much to encourage clinicians to adopt an evidence-based approach to clinical practice.</p>
<p>Evidence-based leadership is more than informed decision making. It&#8217;s about holding space for the whole organization to routinely practice the behaviors of high performance, leading by example.</p>
<p>The &#8220;evidence&#8221; is the fact that influence a decision and provide a coherent to which extent explicit chain of reasoning and improvement to a valid outcome. (Trybus. M, 2007)</p>
<p>Evidence-based decision -making “helps people make well-informed decisions by having the best available evidence and manage the outcome, therefore improve the standard to provide the best practice and promote the trusted environment.</p>
<p>To what extent you think management has been system affected when merged with the practical, evidence-based approach?</p>

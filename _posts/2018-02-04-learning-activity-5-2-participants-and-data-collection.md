<h3>Participants and Data Collection</h3>
<h4>What sampling strategy was used and was it justified?</h4>
<p>While Cerit does not clearly state the sample size in relation to the total number of teachers in Düzce, Turkey, 700 teachers were surveyed (2009. p. 608). I assume this is through a non probability sample using convenience sampling (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015. p. 235) and that Cerit was give the opportunity to sample all teachers that volunteered in the 29 schools visited (Cerit, 2009. p. 608).</p>
<h4>Is the sample size appropriate and justified?</h4>
<p>Again, I am assuming that the total ratio of teachers to people in the region of  Düzce, Turkey is not much greater than the 700 teachers he surveyed. Though, the population of Düzce, Turkey is 323,000 (Wolfram Alpha, 2018) I am not able to find how many elementary teachers there are in that region. Cerit (2009) does not state the reasons for choosing the 29 schools but the assumption is that Cerit (2009)  gave the questionnaire to an appropriate amount of people given the likely size of the overall population density of teachers in the region.</p>
<h4>Are good quality measures used to gather data? How do you know they are good quality?</h4>
<p>Yes, as seen in my Learning Activity 5.1 Cerit (2009) used a variety of statistical tools to analyze the data and ensure there were no cultural variable influencing the results.</p>
<h4>Are the data gathered using ethical procedures?</h4>
<p>Teachers were given the same standard questionnaires developed in previous research models that were tested against statistical analysis to provide a valid standard of opinion on the topics of servant leadership, and job satisfaction.</p>
<p>I rated this study 19/21 on the Rating Scale for Evaluating the participants and data collection in a quantitative research report (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015. p. 250).</p>

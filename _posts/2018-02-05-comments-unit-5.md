<p>I totally agree, with your thoughts/question, more often than not I do not understand the procedure they use to analyze the accuracy of their data and I just assume it is valid. I feel like the fact that this is academic research predicates a duty on the part of the author to analyze their own research to the best of their ability with the most honest answers possible. The fact that it is peer reviewed helps to keep them honest in their procedures even if we can&#8217;t, that being said, what happens when we are the ones that are reviewing them. It is our duty to understand the research methodology to the best of our ability. I have googled so many statistical analysis tests and types of questionnaires. In the last activity I had to look up the SPSS. So to answer your question, in general, No I don&#8217;t think we need to understand all the tools used, but we should have a better than basic understanding of them just in case we are called to double check their work.</p>

<p>I do the same thing. When the author uses a tool or strategy for research that was developed by another author and the author shows that at least one other research study has used that tool, I just assume it is a valid tool for research. Where as, when I see a tool/questionnaire created by the author, I am more likely to question its bias/validity. This practice is not the best practice, we should question the validity of all research methodology in order to understand variables that might have been missed that would alter the research, regardless of whether the tool, strategy, questionnaire, etc has been used in multiple research studies or is new to the one we are reading.</p>

<p>On first reading I usually examine the hypothesis, methodology and the conclusions to get an overview of the study as a whole. It is usually not until the second or third reading that I actually review the statistics, tables, data to see the specific results of the research. I feel that by doing this I can gain an understanding of the authors intent and method which helps me understand any intrinsic bias, before I delve into the data to check their proof.</p>

<p>Great question, my first red flag is when I look at the population of the selected participants and see little diversity or a specific group of people that all might hold a bias that will affect the results. After that I look at the tools used to interact with the participants and see if there is any author created bias in that. There are many things that can affect the results of a research report, but those are the two that I find to be them most obvious and biggest factors of influence.</p>

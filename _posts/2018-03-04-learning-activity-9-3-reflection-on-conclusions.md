<h3>Reflection on Conclusions</h3>
<h4>The most important thing for me about the conclusions section of a high-quality research report is:</h4>
<p>The author of a research report must thoughtfully reflect on the results of their research and determine the implications for both society and future research in academia. They must be brutally honest in their reflection and evaluate the limitations of their research to assess the value of their conclusion. If their research study does not evaluate the shortcomings of their research method and results they can not really make a useful conclusion. In order to summarize what one has learnt from their research, they must also understand what they might have missed. Â I also find the applications for future research important in that it challenges the reader to take the information learnt through the research project and advance it into their own field of study.</p>
<h4>Question for Discussion:</h4>
<p>One of the greatest parts of research is the ability to make a hypothesis and find out that your predictions were wrong. When we make mistakes we learn more than if our predictions were right. Do you as a reader judge a researcher negativity if their results are unexpected? Does fell like it provides more or less validity to their conclusion?</p>

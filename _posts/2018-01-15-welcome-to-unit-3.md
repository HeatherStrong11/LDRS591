This week in Unit 3 you will be discovering how to develop your professional scholarly voice, particularly through your scholarly writing.  This means that you will be reading content that will help you understand that there are different writing styles that are used in the world of academia and how important it is to use APA style in the MA Lead program.

Your learning activities this week are focused on applying the APA standards for general aspects of writing, mechanics of writing and citing sources.  You will also get to apply these skills in assignment 2 which is your scholarly article review, and then continue to practice them in assignment 3 and 5.

For your learning activities this week you will need to select one scholarly peer-reviewed article from your database search in unit 2 to respond to the questions in the learning activities.  Make sure that you select an empirical research study, not a descriptive, commentary or opinion article.  An empirical study can include a systematic literature review, quantitative study, qualitative study, or a mixed-methods study.

These are some key features to look for when identifying empirical research.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> Not all of these features will be in every empirical research article, some may be excluded, use this only as a guide.

<ul>
<li>There is an introduction with a literature review</li>
<li>Research questions are clearly identified</li>
<li>There is a statement of methodology</li>
<li>Participants that are being studied are identified/described</li>
<li>Tools such as surveys, interviews, tests or focus groups were conducted</li>
<li>Data is presented regarding the findings (either in numbers or words)</li>
<li>There is discussion of the results included</li>
<li>Citations/references are included</li>
</ul>

<h3>APA Video Resources</h3>

If you are having trouble making your way through each chapter of the APA manual I completely understand!  It can be quite dry.  I have found some you tube videos that show you in a visual form what you need to know.  You can find those videos here:

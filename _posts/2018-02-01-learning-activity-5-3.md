Jenkins, M., &amp; Stewart, A. C. (2010). The importance of a servant leader orientation. <em>Health Care Management Review, 35(1),</em> 46-54.

<strong>Were descriptive analyses reported?</strong>

The study states how the data was analyzed. Most variables were measured using a 5-point Likert scale which was then converted to a standard z-score measurement.

Rating: 3

<strong>What inferential statistics were used? (e.g., correlations, regression analysis, ANOVA, t-test)</strong>

Correlation and multivariate regression statistics were given both in writing and in table format. These statistics were analyzed thoroughly.

Rating: 3

<strong>What were the results? (What was found?)</strong>

The article had three hypotheses. The first hypotheses was confirmed through the study, namely, that when nurse managers are perceived by nurses as having a commitment to serve, the nurse is likely to have greater job satisfaction. Likewise, the second hypotheses was supported as the study showed a positive relationship between role inversion behaviour and job satisfaction. However, the study concludes that it is the interaction between a commitment to serve and role inversion behaviours that maximizes job satisfaction and that taken separately, job satisfaction will not be maximized. This supports the third hypotheses.

<strong>Did the analysis represent a good quantitative process?</strong>

The analysis did indeed represent a good quantitative process as the data was gathered, analyzed, and reported thoroughly. The statistical results were based on the gathered data. The data was confusing at times but it was clear the process was sound. The discussion and conclusion sections of the article helped to clarify some of the complexities of the study. Upon rereading the data a second time it was more clear.

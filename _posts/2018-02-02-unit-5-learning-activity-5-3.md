<p><strong>Article</strong></p>
<p>The relationship between the servant leadership behaviors of immediate supervisors and follower’s perceptions of being empowered in the context of small business.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>1. The data were rigorously scored and prepared.</p>
<p><strong>Rate</strong></p>
<p>2=Good</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) Procedures to score the data in a consistent manner were used.</p>
<p>b) The researchers explained how data were prepared and checked the data for errors in the Result section.</p>
<p>c) The researchers did not provide the name of the quantitative statistical software program.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>2. Good descriptive analyses were conducted.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem">Rate</strong></p>
<p>1=Fair</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>There is little information of descriptive statistics that could be identified.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>3. Good hypothesis testing procedures were used.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem">Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) The Pearson Product-Moment correlation coefficient (<em>r</em>) was mainly used to test the relationship between two variables in this study.</p>
<p>b) The researchers objectively applied the five steps of hypothesis testing, such as setting the alpha level, collecting data, calculating the statistic and <em>p </em>values, and making decisions.</p>
<p>c) The alpha level was set at .05, but the researchers did not explain the reason.</p>
<p>d) The value of the statistic (<em>r</em>) and the <em>p </em>value were stated clearly.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>4. The results are comprehensive.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem">Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) There is table in this study which reports the demographic characteristic (N) of the participants.</p>
<p>b) The results presented in the table contain the internal consistency of the instrument&#8217;s items and the identification of the six subscales found among the instrument&#8217;s items.</p>
<p>c) The results response to each of the study&#8217;s research questions.</p>
<p>d) The results are consistent with the overall research design.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>5. The results include sufficient information.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem">Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) The researchers discuss the results of six different facets including the p value and the alpha level respectively. All the p values are less than the predetermined alpha level (.05), which indicate statistically significant results.</p>
<p>b) The effect size is specificaly presented in the Result section.</p>
<p>c) The information included in the table and the text is clear, consistent, and accurate.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>6. The data analysis represents a good quantitative process.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem">Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>The data analysis is a objective and linear process, and the statistical results are found based on the gathered data.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Criteria</strong></p>
<p>7. The results provide a good explanation of the study&#8217;s purpose.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem">Rate</strong></p>
<p>3=Excellent</p>
<p><strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>a) It is clear how the reported results address the study&#8217;s research questions. The authors have interpreted the results and thorough analyses in different aspects.</p>
<p>b) All the statistical tests are clearly related to the study&#8217;s purpose.</p>

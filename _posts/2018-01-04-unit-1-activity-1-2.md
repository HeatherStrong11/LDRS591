There are many factors that could shape the decision-making process of a leader. In my opinion, there are five principal factors: past experience, professional knowledge, personal capability and capacity, emotional intelligence, and worldview. I did not think of one’s worldview in the beginning. While after reading Unit 1 Notes, I sensed that one’s worldview actually played an invisible and significant role in decision-making process. Basically, the formation of a worldview is based on one’s cognitive process, and people control their own destinies and make their own decisions by believing in and acting on the values and beliefs that they hold (Cameron &amp; Green, 2015). Therefore, the contribution of one’s worldview to the decision-making process cannot be neglected anymore.

Moreover, I completely agree with the proposition made in Unit 1 Notes that one’s worldview influences the types of questions that one asks and the processes one uses to find the answers to his or her questions. According to Peterson (2001), one’s worldview can be depicted as a larger cognitive framework. Everyone asks questions and finds the answers in his or her own way, which greatly corresponds to his or her own cognition, preference, and experience. In another word, the way in which an individual understands the world and other people determines the way that the individual thinks and behaves (Peck, 2002). As a result, people observe this world in distinct ways and form their own worldview. As mentioned in the first paragraph, most of the people are unconscious of the power of their worldview playing in the decision-making process and other issues in daily life. Thus, it is understandable that there would be conflicts among people from time to time because the worldview held by them might be completely different. So, it would be interesting to further figure out one question:

How to reconcile opinions of different worldviews to reach an agreement when there is a conflict?

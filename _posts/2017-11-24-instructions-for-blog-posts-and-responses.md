<h3>Instructions for blog posts and responses:</h3>

As you work through the material in this course, you will be asked to respond to questions every week on your own blog. You should have already set up a blog during the Orientation course, and used your blog in 500.

This on-going assignment accounts for 25% of the final grade of this course. The following are the blog posts and responses that you are asked to make listed by Unit and Learning Activity. When you post, remember to tag each entry with the Unit and Learning Activity number so it can be easily searched.

All blog posts should be between 250 and 500 words.

<h5 id="marking-criteria-for-posts-and-responses">Marking criteria for posts and responses:</h5>

<p>The following criteria will be used to assign marks to your blog posts and colleague responses:

<ul>
<li>The original posting is of high quality, showing depth of knowledge on the topic. The post ends with an open-ended question to advance the discussion.</li>
<li>Replies to other students are <strong>posted to your own blog</strong> and provide a link to the original post on another student's blog. Replies are posted on more than one day during the posting period.</li>
<li>Response posts to peers' original postings are respectful, show clear synthesis and evaluation of the content read, and provide depth, breath, or new insight to the topic. Reply posts stimulate thinking and advance the conversation.</li>
<li>As appropriate, references are included from scholarly peer-reviewed non-course text or readings to support what is said in both original and reply posts.</li>
<li>All posts are clearly written and contain no APA/spelling/grammatical errors</li>
</ul>

Marks accumulate at 3% per week 3= outstanding on all criteria above; 2= meeting expectations; 1= not meeting all expectations as outlined above but made an effort; 0 = did not make an effort to answer the question

In Unit 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 you will be asked to provide a brief reflection on the topic for the unit. Below you will find the reflection brief rubric for these specific blog post responses.

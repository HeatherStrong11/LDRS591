<strong>Create a new blog post, and describe what sources of information you will use the most to conduct research on your topic. How will you evaluate these sources to make sure they are credible and reliable sources of information?</strong>

Academic journals and articles I believe will be the basis of most of my research gathering. Although there are both textbooks and e-books available I am concerned about the age of some of these resources. My current research question I am developing is a little broad currently. Evaluating a more explicit focus and some narrower keywords and details will be a priority.

My current question requires two main areas of reading. Sports coaching and leadership development. Having just undertaken the leadership foundations course I feel I have a good sense of relevant background reading. Regarding sports coaching with my background as an athletic director and physical education teacher, I know a lot of the most recent up to date research is available from individual sports&#8217; national governing bodies. Using this as a source though will require discernment as a lot of national sporting bodies have vested interests including various stakeholders, sponsorship deals, etc.

Regarding evaluating research resources, I have found the process we have just been through in learning activity 2.3 &amp; 2.4 reasonably thorough. I am relatively digitally minded so I think using one of the online platforms to help track relevant materials I find will be beneficial. I was surprised during this unit how a simple google search could help ascertain author background, information about the publisher, and whether a piece has been peer-reviewed, etc. The information is widely available it just required peeling back a layer of information. In honesty, I didn&#8217;t do much of that type of background research in my bachelor&#8217;s research project. However, I am starting to understand its importance moving forward in postgraduate work.

My personal and professional interests all intersect at the point of empowering women and children. This is undoubtedly, one of the motivations for the non-governmental organizations I founded in Year 2000. By building a business around these themes, I was able to give it the structure it needs to survive beyond me.

By using the concept map, I was able to identify the following questions for further research;

<ol>
<li>Is empowerment the most viable way for improving the socio-economic fortunes of women?</li>
<li>How best can the effectiveness of social welfare and empowerment programs for women and children be improved?</li>
<li>Are there unexploited avenues for empowering women and children this century? A case study of developing countries.</li>
</ol>

From the above, the one I feel is the strongest to pursue for a future research paper is:

<strong>Are there unexploited avenues for empowering women and children this century? A case study of developing countries.</strong>

The above choice is born out of a genuine desire to explore avenues through which organizations like the one I founded can yet create more positive impact in a more creative manner using limited resources.

It is arguably general knowledge that the issues facing women and children in developing countries are clearly more pronounced than the developing world, hence, the choice of case study.

The main reason for the selection is because I believe that the results of the research could potentially more impact in society by guiding policy makers in governments as well as local and international donor organizations that invest heavily in the developed world.

The research may require literature from education, business, economy, social work, human psychology and related disciplines.

<p>Depending on what the decision I need to make is, different factors affect my decision-making process. At work, I make decisions in my classroom based on past experience and advice from more experienced teachers. The classroom is a quick-paced environment so there is not always time to do thorough research for every decision that needs to be made. Oftentimes this means quickly drawing from past experience and going with &#8220;what feels right&#8221;. At home, I make decisions after taking the time to research the topic thoroughly and discussing our options with my husband. As an individual who values relationships with others, I often base my decisions on how I believe it will make those around me feel. This can be beneficial and detrimental to my decision-making process. In a team, it is important for all members to feel valued and heard in order for the group to function effectively. However, sometimes the best option is not the most popular option and judgement can become clouded when emotions are involved.</p>
<p>I agree with the author&#8217;s statement that one&#8217;s worldview influences the questions that are asked and process that is taken. However, I also believe that critical thinkers and learners are able to remove their biases so long as they are aware of their worldviews and the tendencies they may bring. Learning about others&#8217; worldviews and the questions and processes they have broadens one&#8217;s repertoire of skills and tools. A critical thinker can use this new knowledge to identify his or her own limitations and biases.</p>
<p>As Christians, sometimes our worldviews can be seen as conservative and outdated in a changing and liberal society. How can we stay true to our Christian values and beliefs without seeming inflexible or judgmental to others?</p>

<h3>Reflection on Unit 1 Blog About Leadership Decision</h3>

My leadership decision from unit 1 was in regard to guiding the board and school families towards a decision to prevent the school from financial collapse. Through the use of action research plans, and qualitative research I could have provided more concise research to support my strategies for improving the financial state of the school. There are many research reports and articles on financial stability in private non-profit organizations. Several of those articles could have provided my board with alternative strategies on top of the 10 strategies I suggested. While I don&#8217;t know that I would necessarily have done an action research plan to solve the problem, it might have provided additional feedback from sources I had previously not considered. In the end, I still feel that my decision making was successful to the school I was in. While after my absence from the job, the board ultimately chose to go a different route ,they were very grateful for my planning and strategies and did benefit from them in the short term.

The authors conceptualize evidence-based leadership in diverse ways. Patton, M. (2001) developed his notions of evidence-based leadership by using empirical data to critique widely accepted concepts in the field of evaluation akin to knowledge management, best practices and lesson learned. Among others, he identified how that even the best of leaders may be misguided by widely-accepted concepts of best practices, lessons learned and evaluation. According to Patton, best practices are empirically not different from lessons learned. Both are limited in that they inherently suggest that there must be a single best way to do something. In their place, Patton favored the use of better practices or effective practices described in the right context as against generalizations (from best practices) which could really be misleading and not always yield the best outcomes. Finally, he provided a list of criteria for evaluating and generating high-quality lessons learned. The criteria were based on a review of well-grounded research and theories as against his professional opinion and preferences.<br />
Trybus, M. (2007) described the concepts of scientifically based research (SBR) and the challenges educators face in research-based decision making. Her definitions of SBR reinforced the concepts of evidence-based leadership. As Trybus described the dilemma which educators faced in applying SBR to students and how it affects the quality and quantity of educational research, she went on to describe in very clear detail, the components of a research study and how one could review any research even if one had not taken a formal research course. Her submission also described the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) project and how it helps decision-makers with the information needed to accessing evidence-based research. The transformation role for which the WWC was intended in the education sector was also emphasized. Trybus concluded by explaining how a balance should be struck between applying professional wisdom and empirical evidence in the education sector – concepts which are by all means applicable to the practice of leadership.<br />
Finally, Walshe, K. and Rundall, T.G. (2001) provided their perspective by considering how health care professionals had used evidence from scientific research in clinical practice and how such practice may also be applied to health care management. Among others, these authors provided abundant empirical research and evidences. They also described in detail, the process for making decisions based on the research. Minute details of how the ideas of evidence-based practice may be applied in health care management were also presented alongside a synopsis of the future development of evidence-based management in health care.

Evidence may be understood as that which provides a basis for belief (proof). Without evidence, nothing can be proven.<br />
A leaders’ decision-making will be influenced by a lot of factors, most of which are usually out of the leaders’ control but evidence based decision making helps provide a clear standard with better practices and insights.<br />
It improves transparency, accountability and value. It can also enhance the quality of leadership delivered.

How practical is evidence based decision-making in routine real world scenarios in which a leader may be required to take spontaneous decisions?

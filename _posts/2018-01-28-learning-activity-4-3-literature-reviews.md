<h3>Literature Reviews</h3>
<h4>Does the review include relevant literature? (3)</h4>
<p>Parris and Peachey include many relevant journals and authors experienced in the field of leadership study. They mention Greenleaf, (Parris &amp; Peachey, 2013. p. 378) who is the creator of the term servant leadership and cite authors from various academic studies that are currently (the last 15 years) researching servant leadership.</p>
<h4>Does the review examine sources that are recent and of high quality? (3)</h4>
<p>The majority of the sources are from academic peer reviewed journals, while Parris and Peachey also cite dissertations, handbooks of leadership such as Northouse (1997) and Bass (2008). Paris and Peachey use modern and accurate search engines to research their articles such as Ebsco, Academic Search Complete, and International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (Parris &amp; Peachey, 2013. p. 381). All of their sources appear reputable, peer-reviewed and original (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015. p. 132)</p>
<h4>Is the literature review documented properly? (2)</h4>
<p>All literature is cited using in-text citation according to APA style rules. However, they do not include page numbers when referencing other works in their in-text citations. (Except their citation of Don Quiote on page 389 where they include a page number). This appears common practice in journals, yet it would be far more beneficial if the Parris &amp; Peachey included this. They cite all works on pages 390-393.</p>
<h4>Is the literature thoughtfully synthesized? (2)</h4>
<p>The article is well thought out, and organized into appropriate themes/headings. They use APA levels 2 and 5. Some of their titles are not in accordance with APA format on page 139 of Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015).</p>
<h4>Is the literature critically examined? (3)</h4>
<p>According to the PlumX metrics and the scopus review the article has been cited 83 times in other peer journals. I would imagine this would be enough review to make it critically examined, though some of the articles I have been reading for my research are much higher.</p>
<h4>Does the study have a strong foundation in the literature? (3)</h4>
<p>The study&#8217;s problem and purpose are clear, their research methodology is accurate and in accordance with empirical research methods.</p>
<h4>Does the literature fit the study’s overall approach? (3)</h4>
<p>It is predominantly a qualitative study that reviews the study of servant leadership from a literary research perspective. Some of their methods to reduce bias could be viewed as quantitative, but as a whole the article is viewed through a conceptual framework that is very qualitative in nature. This makes sense when reviewing previous literature on a subject.</p>
<p>As a whole Parris and Peachey have a high quality article as they scored 19/21 on Plano-Clark and Creswell&#8217;s rating scale for evaluating the literature review in a research report (2015. p.144)</p>

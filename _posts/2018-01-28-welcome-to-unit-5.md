<p>In this unit we want to explore the next major section of a research report:  The methods and results section.  In this, we will see that the methods section indicates the <strong>overall plan</strong> for how the research was conducted, how the data was collected, and what the analysis of the data tells us.  These may be termed research design, method, and analysis and results, respectively.  In unit 5 we will be looking at the methods and results sections of <strong>quantitative research reports</strong>.</p>
<p>Once again we start with the reminder that we are <i>reviewing</i> these materials in order to become an <em>informed consumer of research</em>, rather than research experts.  Before we get into the specifics of the methods and results of quantitative research reports, it would be helpful to take a step back and remind ourselves of some of the features of the broader research landscape.</p>
<p>Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) assert that &#8220;a quantitative research approach is indicated when the research problem requires an <i>explanation</i>, while a qualitative research approach is indicated when the research problem requires <i>exploration&#8221;</i> (pp. 85-86).   Expanding on that somewhat, Leedy and Ormrod assert that quantitative research has three purposes:  to explain and predict, to confirm and validate, and to test theory.  In contrast, qualitative research has three distinct purposes:  to describe and discover, to explore and interpret, and to build theory (Leedy &amp; Ormrod, 2010, p. 96).  These differing research purposes find expression in differing research processes, the kinds of data gathered, the approaches to data analysis, and finally in the ways findings are communicated.</p>
<p>Do not let the work that you will be doing in quantitative research reports this week overwhelm you.  I am here to support you and if you have any questions at all or need further explanation of something you read about, please do not hesitate to reach out and contact me.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

I depicted in my concept map, Leadership, teaching, volunteering, and inquiring are salient interest to me. Leadership is my professional goal to utilize my knowledge and leadership skills, encourage and promote innovative ideas to advance healthcare professional. I value my community and support my culture that brings public health interest and always places patient safety first.In the sense of volunteering, I strive to coordinate and promote telehealth seminars of interest offered by BCSLS to Abbotsford Regional Hospital and Cancer Agency Laboratory. My ultimate goal is, providing and expanding opportunities for our members to achieve and communicate to gain advice and support one another in their professional practice and career development

Teaching the competencies of medical laboratory science that apply to the role of medical laboratory technologist to achieve the requirements for practice, and not limited to advocate them and support their needs to cultivate new capabilities that will serve our community.

In a positive sense, when it comes to teamwork, I have committed to team growth’ committing to teaching, training staff and allow them to learn. To serve better our students from BCIT, I attend to each student’s needs, acts as a mentor or coach the students and listen to their concerns and needs. I convey empathy and support and keep communication open. Share the positive energy, and places challenges, then celebrate their contributions to the team. Additionally, I have many reasons for choosing Transformational Servant Leadership to pursue since it applies to many areas in my timeline career.

Pieces of evidence show a bright and interesting tie between conflict management and leadership construct. Moreover, strategic intention need not remain fixed during the conflict; therefore an understanding of leadership style help to comprehend conflict handling strategy. It is inspiring and will allow me to reach my full potential, thus motivating personal growth.

I am motivated to the core of the leadership competency model involves transformational servant leadership values

In respect to the interconnections between different views and the relations that may comprehend new potential research questions to my preference, I conclude three research questions amenable to scholarly inquiry.

Research question 1. What are the strategic techniques will help the trainee to manage conflict?

Research question 2. In respect to information inquiry, what is the medium needed for essential information, and what is the ideal way for policymakers to cultivate new capabilities?

Research question 3. what is about “ME” leadership that suggests that “ME” is engaged in the transformational leadership

In respect to research questions, they populated my strongest one to pursue is question 1. In a positive sense, I have committed to team growth’ committing to teaching, training staff and allow them to learn. To serve better our students from BCIT, I attend to each student’s needs and listen to their concerns and needs. I convey empathy and support and keep communication open.

In the Notion of anticipating searching for literature, I am motivated to the core of the leadership competency model that involves transformational servant leadership values.

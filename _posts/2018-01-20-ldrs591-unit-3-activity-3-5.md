<strong>Direct quote &#8211; less than 40 words</strong>

Despite the rise in resources for disaster preparedness and response capacities, Nilsen (2012) believes &#8220;these efforts primarily benefit the general population, though preparedness for vulnerable and special needs populations are generally lacking&#8221; (p. 8).

<strong>Direct quote &#8211; more than 40 words</strong>

Nilsen (2012) explains the use of networks in the non-profit sector below:

Networks are usually thought of as interorganizational relationships with a central, usually larger organization, guiding and working with other organizations in an integrated effort, often connected socially rather than through binding contracts. Networks however, have played a role in the nonprofit world by providing a more efficient way to deliver servicesÂ  to a particular population [&#8230;] These nonprofit networks are most relevant in that they usually work within a common problem domain and work collaboratively to secure the resources each needs to deliver services&#8221; (Nilsen, 2012, p. 10).

<strong>Paraphrased idea</strong>

Utilizing networks to gain resources, new information and connections, or space can develop an organization&#8217;s response capacity (Nilsen, 2012, p. 17).

Many factors influence my decision-making process as a leader. I often think of how a decision will impact people and what people will then think of me as a leader. This is something I am learning to balance, as I do not want to be overly sensitive to the criticism and thoughts of others. There have been times where I have cared too much about one person&#8217;s opinion and have second-guessed myself in order to keep people happy. Another factor that influences me is whether a decision aligns with the mission of the organization that I am a part of. Keeping this at the forefront allows me to stay focused on the larger goal and not get caught up trying to accomplish something that never should have been done at all. Finally, I am always trying to ask the question, &#8220;How does this decision affect the team I am working with?&#8221; This question keeps me focused on the people around me and forces me to put myself in their position in order to see things from a different perspective.

I certainly believe our worldview influences the process of asking and answering questions. For someone who has the perspective that money is the only thing that matters in life and attaining money is the ultimate goal, they will most likely care very little about how their employees or coworkers feel about their job, unless they are not making the company money. To use the example given in the notes, as someone with a Christian worldview, we believe all people are made in the image of God. Therefore, regardless of how we think of money we also believe people have inherent value and worth. This will undoubtedly affect how we ask questions and find answers. It is so important to know what &#8220;lens&#8221; we are wearing as our worldview as it will have important consequences on our thinking and decision-making. Likewise, it is important to know the worldview of the people who we are leading, or, who are potentially leading us as this too will have consequences. This leads me to my question.

How do we reconcile and move forward as leaders when the people we are leading have a different worldview than us?

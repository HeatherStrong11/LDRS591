<strong>Response-Unit10</strong>

In response to Leona

As noted, consistent findings between replicated studies is a good indication of the study’s accuracy. What I noticed for relatively “new” research topics, there are few studies to compare with one another to gage the accuracy of the findings. How would you suggest evaluating the credibility of a study’s finding if there is little literature about a topic to compare the findings to?

Researchers try to get their research published as a final step in the research process. They aim for publication in professional journals to ensure the most appropriate readership and potential contribution to professional practice. Peer review is a quality control mechanism that provides the credibility of the findings and overall the research. Rigorous method, the trustworthiness of the documentation, strength, and weakness any practical or theoretical implication will add to the value of the research. The evidence is relevant and valuable in a decision-making process, therefore, evaluating the findings has to resonate with the evidence. Authority- evidence base, a reliable author would provide a reader with no doubt the answer to any questions related to the findings if it scrutinized adequately.

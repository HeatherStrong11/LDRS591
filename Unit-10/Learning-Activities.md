### Learning Activity 1: Blog post 1

On day one inthis course I asked you to take a moment to think about a recent decision you made as a leader. I asked you to think through on what did you base this decision? Previous experience? Values? Company policy? Empirical evidence \(e.g., data derived from research\)? Expert opinion?



Today my question is a little different. I want to know, if after taking this class, would you make your decisions differently?

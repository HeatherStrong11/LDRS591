### Learning Activity 1: Blog post 1

In unit 1 you were asked to blog about a recent decision you made as a leader. You were then asked to think through how you made that decision. For example, did you base the decision on previous experience, values, company policy, empirical evidence \(e.g., data derived from research\), expert opinion?

In this unit, my question is a little different. I want to know, if after taking this class, would you make your decisions differently?  What new insights have you learned and how would those insights inform your decision making process now?

Please post your response to this question on your blog under 'Learning Activities' under 'unit 10'.

### Learning Activity 2: Blog post 2

This course has emphasized evidence-based leadership by equipping you to access, evaluate, and apply the latest empirically-based evidence and contribute to the scholarship base in the area of leadership studies.

My hope is that this course will convince you of the importance of basing your leadership decisions on the best evidence available in a given context. In light of what you have learned in this course, prepare a blog post explaining why you think evidence-based decision making is important for the Transformational Servant leader.

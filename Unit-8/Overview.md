### Overview:

We want to shift our focus from the highly theoretical and rigidly structured forms of formal research that we have considered thus far and to look at a form of research that you are more likely to employ as a leaderâ€”action research. Action research has evolved as a method well suited to leadership and organizational studies as well as in educational settings. In unit 8 we will explore how action research is related to, and yet distinct from, other forms of research that we have explored to date.  If formal research approaches \(qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods\) are aimed at generating new knowledge, action research is aimed at finding solutions to local problems and issues.

### Learning Objectives: 

1. Differentiate the characteristics of action research.
2. Appraise the applicability of action research to leadership studies. 
3. Critique the features of an action research report.
4. Assess the implications of action research for leadership practice. 
5. Consider ways action research might be utilized in your leadership practice.

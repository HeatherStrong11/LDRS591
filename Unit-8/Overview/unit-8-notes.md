### Action Research Design

Action research has been defined as “a form of applied research whose primary purpose is to increase the quality, impact, and justice” of professional practice \(Gall, Gall & Borg, 2007, p. 597\).  Its purpose is to solve local problems through the application of systematic investigation.  The problem is local, the investigation is local, and there is little concern for generalizing results to other settings.  Gay \(1987\) states“the primary goal of action research is the solution of a given problem, not contribution to science” \(p. 8\).  Action research may employ virtually any research methodology, and will commonly be conducted collaboratively with other professionals.  Action research differs from more formal research in some important ways.

Formal research is typically conducted by researchers with a great deal of experience and/or training in research, and who wish to produce new, generalizable knowledge.  Action research is typically conducted by those with much less experience in and knowledge of research, with the intention of solving a current, local problem.  Formal research typically employs random or representative sampling techniques, while action research will typically employ convenience sampling.  Formal research designs typically exhibit rigorous controls, with a long time frame, while action research designs display more casual procedures, often employing emergent designs, and are focused on short-term time frames \(Gall, Gall & Borg 2007, p. 598\).  Action research can serve personal, professional, and political purposes.

At its heart, action research is cyclical in nature.  Gill and Johnson \(2002\) assert that action research is a planned intervention by a researcher, or more often a consultant, into some natural social setting, such as an organization.  The effects of that intervention are then monitored and evaluated with the aim of discerning whether or not that action has produced the expected consequences.  In other words, the researcher acts upon his or her beliefs or theories in order to change the organization \(Gill & Johnson, 2002, p. 71\).  Going back to Boyer’s model of scholarship, what distinguishes action research as research or scholarly inquiry  \(i.e., as more than problem-solving\) is the explicit commitment to contribute to existing knowledge, even if it is not widely generalizable.

The method of action research presented by Gill and Johnson \(2002\) draws on Lewin’s theory of studying things through changing them \(i.e., change as the method or process of research\).  Stringer and Genat \(2004\) outline a research process that has action as final step, after eliciting stakeholder perspectives, analyzing data \(identifying key features of stakeholder experience\), and writing the research report \(i.e., change as the outcome of research\).  Stringer and Genat also emphasize the participatory process of action research in which change is brought about through the participants in the research project, rather than being imposed on them from the outside.  They explain that a major purpose of participatory approaches to inquiry is to bring people together in a dialogic and productive relationship, enabling the development of a sense of community through the sharing of perspectives, the negotiation of meaning, and the development of collaboratively produced activities, programs, and projects \(Stringer & Genat, 2004, p. 9\).

Glanz \(1998\) has suggested that an action research cycle consists of six steps, which may or may not be always addressed in order.  The usual first step is to select a focus.  This is typically followed by data collection, then the analysis and interpretation of the data.  The analysis and interpretation of data typically would suggest action to be taken.  Action is followed by a period of reflection on the results of the action, and on the basis of this reflection, the action is either continued or modified.  The cycle then comes full circle to begin with a new focus \(Glanz, 1998, p. 27\).

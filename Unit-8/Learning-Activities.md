### Learning Activity 1:

1. Read chapter 13 "Action Research Designs" in Plano-Clark and Creswell \(2015\).
2. Watch the following video by John Spencer \(2017\) that explains what action research is [http://www.spencerauthor.com/how-action-research-sparks-innovation-and-boosts-creativity-in-the-classroom/](http://www.spencerauthor.com/how-action-research-sparks-innovation-and-boosts-creativity-in-the-classroom/) 

### Learning Activity 2: Blog post 1

This learning activity asks you to think about some practical problems that you have faced in your professional life that you would like to change.  In a new blog post list three problems that matter to you and that you think you can systematically address in your work situation.  Please post your professional issues on your blog. For situations that require confidentiality, please change the names of any person or organization that you are referring to.  Add your post to the 'Learning Activities' and 'Unit 8' categories.

### Learning Activity 3:

This learning activity asks you to develop an action research project and present the project idea in a podcast. There is a section of the Orientation that explains how to create a podcast. If you know how to create video you are welcome to do that instead. It is your choice whether to create a podcast or video.

##### Instructions: {#criteria-and-evaluation}

* Using one of the ideas from learning activity 2, create an action research project that follows steps 1-8 for planning an action research study described by Plano-Clark and Creswell \(pp. 440-442\).

* Your introduction should include a grabber, your key idea and explain the structure of your presentation.

* Your project idea should relate to a practical leadership issue you are currently facing.

* Your project idea should be clear and well organized.

* Fits within 3-5 minutes but no more than 6 minutes

* Conclusion gives a call to action

* Use appropriate vocal animation, articulation, tone, volume, fluid communication.

* Please submit this assignment in the Unit 8 Learning Activity 3 forum on the Learning Management System.

### Learning Activity 4:

This learning activity asks you to peer review two projects by colleagues in the class.  The instructor will inform you of the projects that you will be peer reviewing.

Make notes about the strengths of the presentation as well as areas to work on \(clarify, more analysis, more personal application\) by using the evaluation criteria for an action research study outlined by Plano-Clark and Creswell on page 444-445.  Here are questions you should address in your evaluation:

* Does the project focus on a real problem in practice?
* Does the researcher plan to study his or her own practices or plan to collaborate with community members?
* Does the project include careful reflection about the problem?
* Does the researcher plan to gather several sources of information \(e.g., qualitative and quantitative procedures\)?
* Does the researcher develop a clear plan for addressing the problem?
* Does the project include reflecting, thinking, looking, and gathering information and acting?
* Will the results of the project enhance the lives of those involved?

Summarize your notes in a response to your colleagues projects in 250-350 words**.  **Please post your review on your colleagues post on the Unit 8 Learning Activity 3 forum on the Learning Management System. Remember that your response will be visible to all members of the class in the forum.

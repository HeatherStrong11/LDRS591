### Learning Activity 2: Blog Post 1

According to Plano-Clark and Creswell \(2015\) "research is a process of steps used to collect and analyze information in order to increase our knowledge about a topic or an issue" \(p.4\).  Create a new post, and explain what your experience is with "research". Next, discuss at least one example of a decision you have made as a leader and explain how you made that decision. Make sure to include what type of information you used to base your decision on \(e.g., values, research, policy, past experience, expert opinion\)? If you are uncertain about how to set-up your blog, use the link at the bottom of this page to access How to information.

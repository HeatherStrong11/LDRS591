### What is scholarly writing?

According to Heady \(2013\), graduate-level \(or scholarly\) writing is "clear, correct and concise, but it adds the elements of originality and discipline specific expertise" \(p. 2\).  Heady suggests that graduate-level writing explores a topic or a research question in an original way, demonstrates extensive research done on the topic, has a strong organizational structure, and is written for a professional audience.  The scholarly writer writes in a way that is skillful, engaging and organized well so that the paper moves from point to point allowing the reader to follow in a logical progression.

Heady \(2013\) also states that "a good paper has a clear and obvious structure: you can enter it through a clear, well-composed introduction, you move from section to section, and you exit where you know you have been and what you have seen" \(p.73\).

##### Structure and Organization

Writing a scholarly paper often follows a very distinct organizational structure and includes: a title page, an introduction, methods and results, and a conclusion or a discussion.  Within each section of a scholarly paper, each paragraph utilizes a combination three types of content: claims, evidence and transitions.  Heady states that "claims are the points you want to prove, interpretations you want to offer, and assertions you want to make.  Evidence is the material you use to back up your claims.  Some examples of types of evidence that may be used to support claims include: quotes from a book, citations from an article, data from a study, personal experience, historical facts, statistics, etc.  Transitions are one or two words that help you move from one claim to another" \(pp. 74-75\).

An example of the three types of content \(claims, evidence and transitions\) included in a paragraph of scholarly writing is provided below from the article "A Systematic Literature Review of Servant Leadership Theory in Organization Contexts" by Parris and Peachy \(2013, pp 377-378\):

"Over the years, some leadership scholars have called attention to the implicit connection between ethics and leadership.  A burgeoning new research area and leadership theory that has been linked to ethics, virtues and morality is servant leadership \(Graham 1991; Lanctot and Irving 2010; Parolini et al. 2009; Russell 2001; Whetstone, 2002\). Despite servant leadership being coined by Robert K. Greenleaf over three decades ago in 1970, it remains understudied yet prominently practiced in boardrooms and organizations \(Bass and Bass 2008; Spears 2005\)."

From the example above, you can see that a claim is written in the first sentence.  A claim with supporting evidence is provided in the second sentence \(with references\) and the transition begins in the third sentence with the word "despite". The third sentence also includes a claim and supporting evidence. This paragraph structure is typical of what you would find in scholarly writing.  Scholarly writing involves putting your own thoughts and ideas \(claims\) in context by ensuring that you are citing the ideas of those who have influenced you\(APA, 2010, p.169\).

Heady \(2013\) suggests 5 general rules you should always follow when you are organizing your paper \(p. 80\):

1. You must provide enough background information to give your reader a good working knowledge about the topic that you are writing about.
2. Your background information must lead logically to your research question.
3. All claims must be backed up by evidence.
4. All evidence must be related to a claim.
5. If evidence does not back up a claim, you need to explain why and/or account for it.

##### Critical thinking

One of the distinguishing features of scholarly writing at the graduate-level is the practice of critical thinking.  Critical thinking is "that mode of thinking — about any subject, content, or problem — in which the thinker improves the quality of his or her thinking by skillfully analyzing, assessing, and reconstructing it" \(Foundation for Critical Thinking, 2015\).  In addition, critical thinking also involves creating new and original information, conclusions and ideas \(Heady, 2013\).

### APA formatting

There are a wide variety of publication styles that are employed today in universities and in scholarly publications.  A few that you may be familiar with are Chicago style, MLA style, Turbian style and APA style.The American Psychological Association has developed a writing a writing style that is used to establish a standard of written communication.  This standard includes: the organization of content, writing style or writing mechanics, citing references, and how to prepare a manuscript for publication in certain disciplines.  

Aside from simplifying the work of editors by having everyone use the same format for a given publication, using APA style makes it easier for readers to understand a text by providing a familiar structure they can follow.  Abiding by APA's standards as a writer will allow you to:

1\) Provide readers with cues they can use to follow your ideas more efficiently.

2\) Provides readers with information to help them locate information of interest to them.

3\) Allow readers to focus more on your ideas by not distracting them with unfamiliar formatting.

3\) Establish your credibility in the field by demonstrating an awareness of your audience and their needs as fellow researchers.

##### Developing your professional voice

When you are asked to write scholarly papers, what you are really being asked to do is to develop your professional voice \(McDonald, 2011\).  A professional voice can be described as utilizing formal language, good vocabulary and appropriate tone in your written and oral communications \(Basics of Scholarly Voice, 2017\).   Essential elements of a strong professional voice are writing concisely, and writing with clarity and precision \(McDonald, 2011\).  Developing your professional voice is important because some students will turn their papers into professional manuscripts that will be submitted to a journal or a book. McDonald suggests that "for most students, writing papers in graduate school is an exercise in presenting important information in an easy to understand and concise way" \(p.125\).

A well developed professional voice can also benefit you in your professional context.  For example, at work you may be asked to write a briefing document for your school or hospital board, or you may be asked to share your ideas with other professionals at a conference, or you may be asked to write a grant for funding your organizations new project. These are just three examples of professional situations where it is important to have a well-developed professional voice so that you can communicate in a clear and concise way. 

In order to communicate well with your professional voice, you need to have a system to organize your thoughts, the various sections of what you are writing or presenting as well as

Paraphrasing and summarizing provides evidence of comprehension \(rather than direct quotes\).

Important to organize your documentation \(use headings\).

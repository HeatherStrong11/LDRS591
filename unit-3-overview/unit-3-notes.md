### What is graduate-level or scholarly writing?

According to Heady \(2013\), graduate-level \(or scholarly\) writing is "clear, correct and concise, but it adds the elements of originality and discipline specific expertise" \(p. 2\).  For example, Heady suggests that graduate-level writing explores a topic or a research question in an original way, demonstrates extensive research done on the topic, has a strong organizational structure, and is written for a professional audience.  The scholarly writer writes in a way that is skillful, engaging and organized well so that the paper moves from point to point allowing the readers thoughts to follow in a logical progression. 

Heady \(2013\) also states that "a good paper has a clear and obvious structure: you can enter it through a clear, well-composed introduction, you move from section to section, and you exit where you know you have been and what you have seen" \(p.73\). 

##### Thinking like a writer

Academic writing contains a combination of various types of content: claims, evidence and transitions.  Claims are the points you want to prove, interpretations you want to offer and assertions you want to make.  Evidence is the material you use to back up your claims.  Depending on your field of study, more than one type of evidence may be used such as: quotes from a book, citations from an article, data from a study, personal experience, historical facts, statistics, etc.  Transitions are one or two words that help you move from one claim to another.

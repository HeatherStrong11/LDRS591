### What is scholarly writing?

According to Heady \(2013\), graduate-level \(or scholarly\) writing is "clear, correct and concise, but it adds the elements of originality and discipline specific expertise" \(p. 2\).  Heady suggests that graduate-level writing explores a topic or a research question in an original way, demonstrates extensive research done on the topic, has a strong organizational structure, and is written for a professional audience.  The scholarly writer writes in a way that is skillful, engaging and organized well so that the paper moves from point to point allowing the reader to follow in a logical progression.

Heady \(2013\) also states that "a good paper has a clear and obvious structure: you can enter it through a clear, well-composed introduction, you move from section to section, and you exit where you know you have been and what you have seen" \(p.73\).

##### Structure and Organization

Writing a scholarly paper often follows a very distinct organizational structure and includes: an introduction, methods and results, and a conclusion or a discussion.  Within each section of a scholarly paper, each paragraph utilizes a combination three types of content: claims, evidence and transitions.  Heady states that "claims are the points you want to prove, interpretations you want to offer, and assertions you want to make.  Evidence is the material you use to back up your claims.  Some examples of types of evidence that may be used to support claims include: quotes from a book, citations from an article, data from a study, personal experience, historical facts, statistics, etc.  Transitions are one or two words that help you move from one claim to another" \(pp. 74-75\).

An example of the three types of content \(claims, evidence and transitions\) included in a paragraph of scholarly writing is provided below from the article "A Systematic Literature Review of Servant Leadership Theory in Organization Contexts" by Parris and Peachy \(2013, pp 377-378\):

"Over the years, some leadership scholars have called attention to the implicit connection between ethics and leadership.  A burgeoning new research area and leadership theory that has been linked to ethics, virtues and morality is servant leadership \(Graham 1991; Lanctot and Irving 2010; Parolini et al. 2009; Russell 2001; Whetstone, 2002\). Despite servant leadership being coined by Robert K. Greenleaf over three decades ago in 1970, it remains understudied yet prominently practiced in boardrooms and organizations \(Bass and Bass 2008; Spears 2005\)."

From the example above, a claim is written in the first sentence.  A claim with supporting evidence is provided in the second sentence \(with references\) and the transition begins in the third sentence with the word "despite". The third sentence also includes a claim and supporting evidence. This paragraph structure is typical of what you would find in scholarly writing.

Heady \(2013\) suggests 5 general rules you should always follow when you are organizing your paper \(p. 80\):

1. You must provide enough background information to set up your question, but not so much that your reader loses interest.
2. Get to your main point \(or the purpose of your paper\) as quickly as possible.
3. All claims must be backed up by evidence.
4. All evidence must be related to a claim.
5. If evidence does not back up a claim, you need to explain why and/or account for it.

##### Critical thinking

One of the distinguishing features of scholarly writing at the graduate-level is the practice of critical thinking.  Critical thinking is "that mode of thinking — about any subject, content, or problem — in which the thinker improves the quality of his or her thinking by skillfully analyzing, assessing, and reconstructing it" \(Foundation for Critical Thinking, 2015\).  In addition, critical thinking also involves creating new and original information, conclusions and ideas \(Heady, 2013\).

Critical thinking is important in graduate-level writing because....... \(Bloom's taxonomy level 4,5,6 analyze, synthesize, and evaluate\)

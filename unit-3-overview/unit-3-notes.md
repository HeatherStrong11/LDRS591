### What is scholarly writing?

According to Heady \(2013\), graduate-level \(or scholarly\) writing is "clear, correct and concise, but it adds the elements of originality and discipline specific expertise" \(p. 2\).  Heady suggests that graduate-level writing explores a topic or a research question in an original way, demonstrates extensive research done on the topic, has a strong organizational structure, and is written for a professional audience.  The scholarly writer writes in a way that is skillful, engaging and organized well so that the paper moves from point to point allowing the readers thoughts to follow in a logical progression.

Heady \(2013\) also states that "a good paper has a clear and obvious structure: you can enter it through a clear, well-composed introduction, you move from section to section, and you exit where you know you have been and what you have seen" \(p.73\).

### Structure and Organization

Scholarly writing often follows a very distinct structure and includes a combination three types of content: claims, evidence and transitions.  Heady states that "claims are the points you want to prove, interpretations you want to offer, and assertions you want to make.  Evidence is the material you use to back up your claims.  Some examples of types of evidence that may be used to support claims include: quotes from a book, citations from an article, data from a study, personal experience, historical facts, statistics, etc.  Transitions are one or two words that help you move from one claim to another" \(pp74-75\).

An example of the three types of content \(claims, evidence and transitions\) is provided below from the article "A Systematic Literature Review of Servant Leadership Theory in Organization Contexts" by Parris and Peachy \(2013, pp 377-378\):

"Over the years, some leadership scholars have called attention to the implicit connection between ethics and leadership.  A burgeoning new research area and leadership theory that has been linked to ethics, virtues and morality is servant leadership \(Graham 1991; Lanctot and Irving 2010; Parolini et al. 2009; Russell 2001; Whetstone, 2002\). Despite servant leadership being coined by Robert K. Greenleaf over three decades ago in 1970, it remains understudied yet prominently practiced in boardrooms and organizations \(Bass and Bass 2008; Spears 2005\)."

From the example above, a claim is written in the first sentence.  A claim with supporting evidence is provided in the second sentence \(with references\) and the transition begins in the third sentence with the word "despite". The third sentence also includes a claim and supporting evidence. This paragraph structure is typical of what you would find in scholarly writing.  

It is important to remember when you are writing that any time you make a claim you need to provide evidence to support the claim and/or interpretation that you are making.

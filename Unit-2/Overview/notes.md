### The Research Process

Plano-Clark and Creswell \(2015\) define research as "a process of steps used to collect and analyze information in order to increase our knowledge about a topic or issue" \(p. 4\).The 8 steps that Plano-Clark and Creswell \(2015\) identify in the research process provides a useful framework that describes what researchers do when they conduct their studies and help us understand the information that is included in their reports. Listed below are each of the eight steps in the research process.

1. The whole process begins with **identifying the research problem**. This step is vitally important. The statement of the research problem is the very foundation that the subsequent research is built upon, and quite literally guides each and every step moving forward.

2. **Reviewing the literature**: This step is the primary focus of this course. There are two major assignments in this course that are devoted to a\) locating relevant scholarly literature and b\) analyzing, synthesizing, and summarizing what precedent literature has to say.

3. **Specifying the purpose** for the research includes: Identification of the objective of a study \(purpose statement\). This information is typically expressed in a few research questions or hypotheses.

4. **Choosing a research design**– this is where an overall plan or approach of the study is described and a specific method is explained.

5. **Selecting participants and collecting data** which includes: who will be the participants, how you will collect data, what permission you need to obtain.

6. **Analyzing data** means to make sense of the information that has been gathered by utilizing systematic processes to extract meaning. We call this extracted meaning “results”, which are then reported in forms appropriate to the research method.

7. **Drawing conclusions** means interpreting the results and explaining how the conclusions relate to the research questions/hypotheses, and/or similar studies.  There is also a discussion of  limitations of the study and often suggestions of implications for the study for intended audiences, for practice, and for future research.

8. **Disseminating and evaluating the research**: Usually the term “disseminated” means “published.” The most common way that research is disseminated is in journals dedicated to publishing primary research. Many times you will see this sequence followed: Research is completed, research is first published in a PhD dissertation, or as a paper in a symposium or conference, research report then goes to a professional journal for publication and then research eventually is incorporated into a book.

### Accessing Scholarly Literature

The key is to start at the beginning with a good plan and keep yourself organized. Organizing tools are important both to streamline your literature search and to summarize and synthesize. As you begin your literature search \(library books, online periodicals, internet search\), organize your search into general topic areas and more specific keywords. It is very helpful to have some sense of the various fields of social science or other science that will potentially inform your research interests. As we will see very shortly, various fields have particular literature bases associated with each.

Part of your planning and organizing is to recognize various genres of scholarly literature and to be aware of the limitations inherent to each. A very helpful discussion is provided by Plano-Clark and Creswell \(2015\) on pages 10-12.![](/assets/Literaturemap.jpg)There are three different categories of documents where you can find research reports.  They are summaries and books, journal articles and early stage materials. Usually, dissertations or conference papers are where you first find new ideas expressed.

A usual next step is to take a dissertation and either break it down into a series of journal articles or to adapt the dissertation to fit the length of a journal article. Keep in mind this rough time line: By the time a dissertation is successfully defended, the actual research may have been conducted two to three years prior. It could easily take another three years for a journal article to make it through the peer-reviewed process and actually come to print. This would mean that the actual research referenced in the journal article could well be at least five years old. Then, it could easily take another five years for high quality publishers to work through their review processes and bring something to print in a book.  Obviously, what you lose in this is cutting edge thought.

You can refer to Plano-Clark and Creswell \(2015\) pages 10-12 for more details, but the chart below summarizes the relative advantages and disadvantages of each genre of scholarly literature.

| GENRE | ADVANTAGES | DISADVANTAGES | UTILITY |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Summaries \(Encyclopedia's and handbooks\) | Generally highest quality. | Tend to be dated. | Establish a general working knowledge of the field. |
| Books | Generally high quality. | Can be dated. | Establish mainstream thought.  Most foundational literature is found in books. |
| Journal Articles | Generally high quality\*\*\* Provide a clear description of actual research. Generally more current than books or summaries | Generally will not give a full development of application and implications. | Best available balance between quality and currency. |
| Early stage materials \(conference papers, dissertations, newspapers, personal websites etc.\) | Most current cutting edge ideas are found here. | Little review for quality \(except for dissertations\). Ideas are not usually well developed. | Valuable for establishing trends in current thought. Use cautiously. |



\*\*High quality journals are determined by the peer review process,  the journals impact factor\(IF\) and by professional reputation.  The impact factor is a measure of the frequency with which the average article in a journal has been cited in a particular year. The IF is used to measure the importance or rank of a journal by calculating the times it's articles are cited and can be found on the home page of most online journals.

Peer review is the process used by publishers and editors of academic / scholarly journals to ensure that the articles they publish meet the accepted standards of their discipline. Manuscripts being considered for publication are sent to independent experts in the same field \(the author's scholarly or scientific peers\). They evaluate the quality of the scholarship, reliability of findings, relevance to the field, appropriateness for the journal, etc.

Plano-Clark and Creswell \(2015\) provide a very useful tip regarding the sources of literature.  They suggest that although you are probably used to searching for books on a particular topic, it is important to "focus on reading recent research studies published as journal articles to learn the most up-to-date information in your profession" \(pg.11\).  As a general rule of thumb, articles published in the past 10 years should give you a good idea of what is current in your profession.



Good reviews of literature utilize a wide range of genres of scholarly literature. Fields that are rapidly evolving demand a high focus on early stage materials and journal articles. Literature reviews in more established fields none-the-less benefit from including some early stage materials references—this gives some assurance that the researcher or reviewer is reasonably current in the field.

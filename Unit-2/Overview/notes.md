### The Research Process

Plano-Clark and Creswell \(2015\) define research as "a process of steps used to collect and analyze information in order to increase our knowledge about a topic or issue" \(p. 4\).The 8 steps that Plano-Clark and Creswell \(2015\) identify in the research process provides a useful framework that describes what researchers do when they conduct their studies and help us understand the information that is included in their reports. Listed below are each of the eight steps in the research process.

1. The whole process begins with **identifying the research problem**. This step is vitally important. The statement of the research problem is the very foundation that the subsequent research is built upon, and quite literally guides each and every step moving forward.

2. **Reviewing the literature**: This step is the primary focus of this course. There are two major assignments in this course that are devoted to a\) locating relevant scholarly literature and b\) analyzing, synthesizing, and summarizing what precedent literature has to say.

3. **Specifying the purpose** for the research includes: Identification of the objective of a study \(purpose statement\). This information is typically expressed in a few research questions or hypotheses.

4. **Choosing a research design**– this is where an overall plan or approach of the study is described and a specific method is explained.

5. **Selecting participants and collecting data** which includes: who will be the participants, how you will collect data, what permission you need to obtain.

6. **Analyzing data** means to make sense of the information that has been gathered by utilizing systematic processes to extract meaning. We call this extracted meaning “results”, which are then reported in forms appropriate to the research method.

7. **Drawing conclusions** means interpreting the results and explaining how the conclusions relate to the research questions/hypotheses, and/or similar studies.  There is also a discussion of  limitations of the study and often suggestions of implications for the study for intended audiences, for practice, and for future research.

8. **Disseminating and evaluating the research**: Usually the term “disseminated” means “published.” The most common way that research is disseminated is in journals dedicated to publishing primary research. Many times you will see this sequence followed: Research is completed, research is first published in a PhD dissertation, or as a paper in a symposium or conference, research report then goes to a professional journal for publication and then research eventually is incorporated into a book.

### The Research Process

Plano-Clark and Creswell \(2015\) define research as "a process of steps used to collect and analyze information in order to increase our knowledge about a topic or issue" \(p. 4\).The 8 steps that Plano-Clark and Creswell \(2015\) identify in the research process provides a useful framework that describes what researchers do when they conduct their studies and help us understand the information that is included in their reports. Listed below are each of the eight steps in the research process.

1. The whole process begins with **identifying the research problem**. This step is vitally important. The statement of the research problem is the very foundation that the subsequent research is built upon, and quite literally guides each and every step moving forward.

2. **Reviewing the literature**: This step is the primary focus of this course. There are two major assignments in this course that are devoted to a\) locating relevant scholarly literature and b\) analyzing, synthesizing, and summarizing what precedent literature has to say.

3. **Specifying the purpose** for the research includes: Identification of the objective of a study \(purpose statement\). This information is typically expressed in a few research questions or hypotheses.

4. **Choosing a research design**– this is where an overall plan or approach of the study is described and a specific method is explained.

5. **Selecting participants and collecting data** which includes: who will be the participants, how you will collect data, what permission you need to obtain.

6. **Analyzing data** means to make sense of the information that has been gathered by utilizing systematic processes to extract meaning. We call this extracted meaning “results”, which are then reported in forms appropriate to the research method.

7. **Drawing conclusions** means interpreting the results and explaining how the conclusions relate to the research questions/hypotheses, and/or similar studies.  There is also a discussion of  limitations of the study and often suggestions of implications for the study for intended audiences, for practice, and for future research.

8. **Disseminating and evaluating the research**: Usually the term “disseminated” means “published.” The most common way that research is disseminated is in journals dedicated to publishing primary research. Many times you will see this sequence followed: Research is completed, research is first published in a PhD dissertation, or as a paper in a symposium or conference, research report then goes to a professional journal for publication and then research eventually is incorporated into a book.

### Accessing Scholarly Literature

The key is to start at the beginning with a good plan and keep yourself organized. Organizing tools are important both to streamline your literature search and to summarize and synthesize. As you begin your literature search \(library books, readings and books you have received for your MA in Leadership course work, online periodicals, internet search\), organize your search into general topic areas and more specific keywords. It is very helpful to have some sense of the various fields of social science or other science that will potentially inform your research interests. As we will see very shortly, various fields have particular literature bases associated with each.

Part of your planning and organizing is to recognize various genres of scholarly literature and to be aware of the limitations inherent to each. A very helpful discussion is provided by Plano-Clark and Creswell \(2010\) on page 119. Let’s look at this chart for a moment.

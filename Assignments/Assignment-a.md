### Assignment \#1: Clarifying Your Research Interest

The Master of Arts in Leadership program values the application of best practices to your personal and professional practice.  Before we get into some of the concrete realities of accessing scholarly literature, we need you to take time to reflect on and articulate some issues that are salient in your personal and professional life and practice.

The purpose of this assignment is to provide you with an opportunity to develop a concept map depicting your interests \(personal and/or professional\) and use the concept map to generate research questions amenable to scholarly inquiry. A concept map is a general method used by individuals or groups to describe ideas in the form of a picture \(Trochim, 2001\). The basic idea behind concept mapping is to generate a picture of potential ideas that can be used to articulate or refine research areas that are relevant to scientists and stakeholders.

##### Steps to complete this assignment

1. Read Trochim's \(2001\) guidelines for concept mapping at [http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/conmap.htm](http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/conmap.htm).
2. Using Gliffy.com, draw.io or another mapping program, create a map similar to the one pictured below, with you at the centre and your personal and professional interests around the outside.  
   1. The letters A through E represent areas of interest to the researcher \(labelled “You” in the figure below\) and would normally be labelled accordingly in a concept map. For example, A might be health, B might be exercise, and so on with as many different yellow circles as the researcher \(‘You’\) has an interest in exploring.  
   2. The concept map presented in the figure above stopped after one level of abstraction from the researcher \(in other words only one other set of circles was added outside the blue circle identifying the researcher\). It is possible to add other circles to the concept map with more differentiation. Please feel free to include related interests as sub-items from other interests. You might have item A as 'Teaching' and A1 as 'K12' and A2 as 'Higher Ed'.  
   3. On the basis of the areas of interest identified in the concept map, most researchers would proceed to ‘link’ areas together in the form of research questions. For example, if circle A was exercise and circle B was health then possible research questions might include \(1\) Does exercise participation improve or diminish health? \(2\) Does health limit exercise participation? The number \(and nature\) of research questions is not limited and remains at the discretion of the researcher.

   1. Use the program to draw connections between areas of interest. Use a different style of connector for these links.
   2. Download your map as a jpg or png and upload it to your blog.

Create a new blog post with your concept map as the featured image and answer the following questions:
1. What research questions can be generated from combining different areas of personal and/or professional interest you have identified in the concept map? Please state three potential research questions that could be studied.

2. Identify which research question you feel is **the strongest one** to pursue for a future research paper and outline reasons for your selection.
3. What broad fields do you anticipate you may search for literature that might inform your research question? \(E.g., education, business, psychology, healthcare, leadership, religion\)

There are two important things to note here.

1. **Format of Assignment**

There are many online tools available for creating concept maps and many of those are free to use. You might consider using [Gliffy.com](http://gliffy.com/) and exporting your map as a jpg \(Gliffy is free for students...[https://support.gliffy.com/hc/en-us/articles/217895678](https://support.gliffy.com/hc/en-us/articles/217895678)\). There are many other tools available.

Once you have created your concept map, export it as an image and upload it to the Media folder of your blog, then create a new post with your map as the featured image and answer the questions listed above.  The assignment should not exceed 2 type-written pages.

##### Evaluation

1. Personal and/or professional interests are described **\(4 points\).**
2. Interests are clearly labelled on a diagram using electronic software **\(6 points\).**
3. Three potential research questions are identified that could be studied **\(6 points\)**
4. One research question is provided and reasons are clear why it is the strongest one to pursue for future research **\(4 points\).**

**Overall Score = /20**

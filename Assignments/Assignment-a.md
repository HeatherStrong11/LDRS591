### Assignment \#1: Clarifying Your Research Interest

The Master of Arts in Leadership program values the application of best practices to your personal and professional practice.  Before we get into some of the concrete realities of accessing scholarly literature, we would like you to take time to reflect on and articulate some of the salient interests in your personal and professional life and practice.

In this assignment, you develop a concept map depicting your interests \(personal and/or professional\) and use the concept map to generate research questions amenable to scholarly inquiry. A concept map is a general method used by individuals or groups to describe ideas in the form of a picture \(Trochim, 2001\). The picture can then be used to articulate or refine research areas relevant to scientists and stakeholders.

##### Steps to complete this assignment

1. Read Trochim's \(2001\) guidelines for concept mapping at [http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/conmap.php](http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/conmap.htm).
2. Using Gliffy.com, draw.io or another mapping program, create a map similar to the sample pictured below, with you at the centre and your personal and professional interests around the outside.

   1. The letters A through D represent areas of interest to the researcher \(labelled “ME” in the sample below\). For example, A might be "Health," B might be "Exercise," and so on, with as many different yellow circles as you, the researcher \("ME"\) has an interest in exploring.

   2. The sample map stops after one level of abstraction from the researcher \(in other words, only one other set of circles was added outside the blue circle identifying the researcher\). It is possible to add other circles to the concept map with more differentiation. Please feel free to include related interests as sub-items from other interests. You might have item C as "Teaching" and C1 as "K12" and C2 as "Higher Ed."

   3. On the basis of the areas of interest identified in the concept map, most researchers would proceed to "link" areas together in the form of research questions. For example, if circle A was "Exercise" and circle B was "Health," then possible research questions might include:  
         1. Does exercise participation improve or diminish health?  
         2. Does health limit exercise participation?

      There is no limit to the number \(and nature\) of research questions the researcher wishes to include.

3. Use the mapping program to draw connections between areas of interest. Use a different style of connector, such as a dotted line, for these links.

4. Download your map as a .jpg or .png and upload it to your blog.

5. Create a new blog post with your concept map as the featured image and answer the following questions:

   1. What research questions can be generated from combining different areas of personal and/or professional interests you have identified in the concept map? Please state three potential research questions that could be studied.

   2. Identify which research question you feel is **the strongest one** to pursue for a future research paper and outline reasons for your selection.

   3. In what broad fields do you anticipate searching for literature that might inform your research question \(e.g., education, business, psychology, healthcare, leadership, religion\)?

The written portion of your assignment should be 500 words or less.

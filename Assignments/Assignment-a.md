### Clarifying Your Research Interest

The Master of Arts in Leadership program values the application of best practices to your personal professional practice.  Before we get into some of the concrete realities of accessing scholarly literature, we need to give time for you to reflect on and articulate some issues that are salient in your personal professional life and practice.  The following questions will begin to guide the process.

¬    Significant Question:  What are the “significant questions that can be answered empirically” \(Gall, Gall & Borg 2007, p. 35\) relevant to you in your professional life?  State a research problem in complete, grammatical sentences.  In stating your research problem, consider the following:  
•    Is my statement sufficiently broad? Is it clear how the general area of study will be limited or focused?  
•    Does the problem have the potential for providing important and useful answers and information?  
¬    Research Approach: Based on your reading of Plano-Clark & Creswell, do you think your problem statement lends itself more to qualitative or quantitative research \(for data-based approaches\) or to more conceptual research reports?  Defend your position.  
¬    Literature Review: What broad fields of social science do you anticipate might inform your problem statement?  What key words would you begin to with as you conduct a literature search?  
¬    Purpose for Research:  Working with Plano-Clark & Creswell’s definition of research purpose, suggest some focused questions that will serve to guide your upcoming review of precedent literature.

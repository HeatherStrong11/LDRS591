### Assignment \#4 - Literature Review Outline

##### Instructions:

In this assignment you will write an outline for your literature review paper.  An outline can be defined as an organizational plan to help you draft a paper. Writing an outline before beginning a paper is the most effective way to organize your thoughts. An outline begins with identifying your research question and then breaks down the parts of your paper in a clear, hierarchical manner to help you achieve the goal of addressing your research question.  Your outline should include the 5 major sections listed below.  In each section I have provided you with a few questions to help you think through the kind of information you will need to include in each section of your paper.

For this assignment you do not need to use APA style.  You may use the template below and write the answers to the questions in bullet points, but please use complete sentences.

**A\) Introduction:**

•What is the ‘problem’ you are aiming to address?

•What information will you need to provide a broad context for your topic?

•Do you have any relevant statistics that you could use to support "the problem"?

•Why is it important to address this problem?

•What key terms should you define in your introduction so that the reader understands your topic?

•What is the purpose of your paper? Or what research questions are being addressed?

**B\) Methods:**

* How did you chose your articles for your paper?

* What inclusion/exclusion criteria did you use?

* What databases did you search?

* What key search terms did you use?

* How many records were obtained in your search?

* Is there appropriate background information provided?

* Is the research purpose clearly stated?

* Are the strengths and weaknesses of the body of literature addressed?
* Are possible explanations for any inconsistencies in the literature uncovered?

**D\) Discussion:**

* What is the problem you are addressing?
* What are the major results you found?
* How would you interpret your results? \(e.g., what are the gaps, inconsistencies, strengths and weaknesses based on your critical evaluation\).
* Do your results connect with previous research?
* What are the key limitation\(s\) of your results?
* Can you offer a rationale for why future research should be conducted on this topic?
* Why are your findings important?
* What are the practical implications of your findings?

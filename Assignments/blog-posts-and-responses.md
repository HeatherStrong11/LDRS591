### Instructions for blog posts and responses:

As you work through the material in this course, you will be asked to respond to questions on your own blog. You should have already set up a blog during the Orientation course, and used your blog in 500, but if you haven't, you can access instructions through a link below.

This on-going assignment accounts for 30% of the final grade of this course. The following are the blogging posts and responses that you are asked to make listed by Unit and Learning Activity. When you post, remember to tag each entry with the Unit and Learning Activity number so it can be easily searched.+

All blog posts should be between 150 - 250 words.

### **Assignment \#3: Literature Review Search**

The purpose of this assignment is to develop your skills to search, retrieve and review relevant literature. This assignment and Assignment \#5 will be closely linked. This assignment will include the “paper trail” that provides the details of your search for relevant literature, and Assignment \#5 will be the final document that summarizes the findings of your review of precedent literature in scholarly prose.  Please notice that this assignment follows the search strategy suggested by Badke \(2017\).

##### Literature Review Search

1. **Identify your research topic**: In the first paragraph, state the problem you are addressing in at most a few sentences. Next, provide your research question\(s\).
2. **Record your library catalogue search:** In the second section, in point form, identify the searchable keywords and domains of social science that arise from your problem statement. You may use a table similar to Table 1 below to organize this information \(in APA format\).

Table 1. _Library catalogue search_

| Key words used in searches | Number of Hits | Title, author\(s\) and year of  usable results | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

**3. Identify key sources:** In the third section, list 10 scholarly sources that you have found to be potentially relevant to your research question.

a\) Include at least 2 books or e-books and 5-8 journal articles. Present the results in a table similar to Table 2 below.

Please make sure you include the following information in this section:

* The two databases that I choose to search were:

* The search terms that I have decided on are:

Describe in a paragraph how you chose the particular articles you did \(that is, what inclusion and exclusion criteria you utilized\).

Table 2. _Articles from academic databases_

| Database | Search words | Author/Title/Date | Why might this source be relevant? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

b\) Next move into the literature available on the internet by conducting a search using a search engine such as _Google Scholar_. Briefly describe how you found the first website/document, and why or why not what you found was helpful.  Please include the following in this section:

The search engine that I choose to search was:

The search terms that I used were:

Present your results in table format like the one below.

Table 3. _Internet search results_

| Search Engine | Search words | Number of hits | Results | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |

**4. Preliminary investigation summary: **In a fourth section, in several appropriately cited paragraphs, do the following:

\(a\) Present a working knowledge summary of your topic \(the basic facts required to make someone familiar with the topic to a limited extent\) based on what you have discovered about the topic from your initial investigations of literature.

\(b\) Present a brief statement outlining your personal/professional interest in this topic. In essence, you are providing a summary of the topic based on your own experiences and from the reference sources. You will want to superficially describe the relevant issues subsumed in your problem statement, including the urgency, the controversies, and anything else that will convince your reader that your problem statement is worthwhile pursuing.

**5. Reference list: **List all references in APA \(6th edition\) format.** **

**6.** **Assignment formatting: **APA formatting is required for this assignment. Please refer to the APA requirements and APA rubric link.

**7. Submit your assignment: **Use the Assignment 3 drop box on the learning management system.

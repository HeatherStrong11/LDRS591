### Assignment \#5 - Formal Literature Review

In this assignment you will demonstrate your scholarly inquiry learning by writing a graduate-level literature review. Assignment 5 is focused on the professional interest you have identified and defined in Assignment \#1 and extends the work you did in Assignment 2, 3 and 4.  Assignment 5 will be your critical analysis and synthesis of the literature, presented in scholarly prose, fully APA 6 format compliant.

##### Instructions:

**Title page:**

**Abstract:**

An abstract is intended to provide a key synopsis of the entire study so that the reader can determine if he/she wishes to read the full article. An abstract is a concise 250 word \(or less\) single paragraph summary. In a minute or less a reader should be able to learn the purpose of the study, overall research question or objective, a general description of the method or approach, important results, and important conclusions or new questions.

**Introduction:**

Provide one paragraph summarizing in general terms your research topic. This information should stand out and capture your reader’s attention.This introductory material should stand below the restated paper title without any further heading that indicates it is an introduction.

In the next few paragraphs it is important to provide your reader with a brief overview of the problem. It is here that you want to begin to set the stage for your research story. You can build the overview by answering these questions in a few paragraphs: What is the problem? Are there any relevant statistics that address your problem? Why is this problem important to address?

On the basis of your personal knowledge, as well as your investigation of the literature, provide a broad context for your topic by addressing what is known about your topic. It is important also to include the definition of any key terms that you will be using throughout your paper. Also include appropriate reference citations, and include references in the reference list.

On the basis of your personal knowledge as well as your investigation of the literature, provide a brief discussion of the major issues or gaps that have been identified related to the topic that is being investigated. This addresses the importance or the significance of your study.

To conclude this section, provide a brief statement outlining the purpose of the study and be explicit about the research question you will be addressing. If you want, you may also include a paragraph about your personal interest in this topic as a researcher.

**Method:**

Following your introduction you want to tell your reader how you chose your articles to review. This is essentially re-writing the information that you collected for assignment \#3. Here is an example template that you can use:

A review of the literature was conducted to identify scholarly research of XXXX on XXXX. Published articles were identified through searches of electronic databases that were available at the author’s university library. Databases included in this review were: \[list specific databases that you searched\]. The following key subject words were used to search the databases: XXX, XXX, XXX, XXX, XXX, XXX \(include your search terms from assignment \#3 here\). Boolean “AND” was used to combine the XXX terms with the XXX terms. This search resulted in a total of XX articles.

The articles were then manually screened for relevance and attainability. Searches of bibliographies from relevant articles were also performed. Of the XX articles retrieved, XX articles were relevant to this review.

The articles were either kept or eliminated due to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria included the following components: peer reviewed, published 2007-2017, written in English language, accessible through the university library. The exclusion criteria included the following factors:any study that does not meet the inclusion criteria, and non-English full text studies were excluded even if an English translation of the abstract was provided. XX studies met the inclusion criteria and were used in the review. The XX articles were drawn from a variety of scholarly sources. Table 1 depicts the list of journals included in this review, the number of articles from each journal and the database used to access the journal.

_Critical analysis_

In the critical analysis section of the paper you want to tell your reader what strategy you used for organizing, abstracting and critically evaluating important information from the articles you found. For example, this section could look something like this:

For each publication, the methodology that was used to critically appraise each article was 1\) a rating scale for evaluating qualitative studies developed by Plano-Clark and Creswell \(2015\) and 2\) a rating scale for evaluating quantitative studies developed by Plano-Clark and Creswell \(2015\). The classification system that was used to identify high quality and low quality articles was based on the rating scales and the description for how articles were classified as high quality or low quality is presented in the table below.

**Results:**

The main body of text should be in the 2500-3000 word range \(around 10 pages\) exclusive of any title page or references.

In the results section you are now going to organize what you have learned by summarizing the major themes with full reference citations. You may wish to denote these major themes with Level One Headings. If you are organizing your literature review along thematic lines, you may want to use Level Two Headings to further organize sub-themes that emerge within the broader themes. Whether you choose to follow a study-by-study or a thematic approach, it is very important that you do not just simply recite a summary of the research report. The purpose of a literature review is to connect research reports to your stated problem through synthesis. Throughout this process you must critically appraise the relevance and value of the literature. Be sure to use multiple kinds of sources, including books, lectures, research reports, or any of a multitude of sources.

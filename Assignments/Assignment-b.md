### Assignment \#2: Scholarly Article Review

Below you will find a guideline for writing a critique of a journal article. This assignment should be written in APA style format.  Please use your APA manual for details regarding structure and content, writing clearly and concisely, the mechanics of style and crediting sources.

This assignment may be a maximum of 3-4 pages in length. Note that this is rather brief, which requires you to synthesize a lot of information in a concise way. This can often be rather challenging at first. Writing drafts of each section and then editing these to consolidate information is recommended.

**STEP 1:** Select a published, peer-reviewed journal article of your choice and provide the reference for this article in APA format at the top of the page.

**STEP 2:** Summarize the article you selected by answering each of the following questions:

1. What are the key research questions being addressed?
2. Are these questions based on, or related to, previous theory or research?
3. What are \(if any\) the specific study hypotheses?
4. Provide a brief overview of the participant sample, including age, sex, any distinguishing features of the sample, and how they were recruited.
5. Describe the procedures of the study in brief, including what kind of design was used, what methods/measures were used, and in general “how” the subjects were “studied”.
6. Summarize the important findings and relate them back to how they support or don’t support the hypotheses.

**STEP 3:** Discuss the study with a critical eye both for strengths as well as weaknesses. Consider the following questions in your discussion:

1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of this study? Include both what the authors tell you as well as your own thoughts.
2. Does the abstract accurately summarize the article?
3. Does the purpose statement in the abstract match the purpose statement in the introduction?
4. Is all of the information in the introduction organized well?
5. Does the information presented in the introduction allow you to grasp "the problem" under investigation, provide a "broad context" for the problem? 
6. Is there a review of precedent literature on the topic and does the introduction lead coherently to the purpose of the study?
7. Do you think the methods are appropriate for studying the problem?  Explain your reasoning.
8. Do you think the study could be duplicated from the information provided in the methods section?
9. Is the sequence of the methods section clear?
10. Review the results in light of the purpose of the study.  Do the results reveal what the researcher intended?
11. Does the discussion just repeat the results or does the author\(s\) interpret the meaning of the results?
12. Is the author's interpretation supported \(or backed up\) by other research?
13. Are there limitations identified?
14. Are there suggestions for future research? 

**STEP 4:** Speculate on how you might expand upon this research based upon the limitations you have identified. This can be general or more specific. That said, a sweeping statement such as “I would like to study this phenomenon more” doesn’t help us to understand why that might be an acceptable new direction without sufficient justification for your claims. Thus, concrete ideas about the rationale are expected in this section, although explicit details regarding the next study or series of studies are not crucial.

**STEP 5:** APA formatting is required for this assignment.  Please refer to the APA formatting requirments and APA rubric for further information.

**STEP 6**: Submit your assignment using the Assignment 2 drop box on the learning management system.

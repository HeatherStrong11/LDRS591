Course Description
LDRS 591 provides an overview of the process, critical analysis, and associated skills required for scholarship and research.  This course is designed for learners who may have little experience in the area of research, and will provide introduction to scholarly inquiry and various research approaches being used in the field of leadership to the end that learners may become discriminating consumers of research.  Course themes include focus on APA formatting, location and evaluation of scholarly literature, and processes leading to the creation of a graduate level synthetic review of precedent literature.  The course combines theoretical/conceptual understandings with applied practice, and is challenging for most learners.

This course is a pre-requisite for LDRS 697-698. The aim of this online course is to provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary for the completion of the capstone which serves to integrate practical Master of Arts in Leadership program curriculum content.

Course Learning Outcomes
On completing this course, students should be able to:

1.     Appraise and evaluate the research process based upon the values and ethical standards of servant leadership.
2.     Demonstrate critical thinking and analytic skills characteristic of a rigorous   approach to scholarship.
3.     Distinguish between Boyer’s Scholarship of Application, Integration, Teaching, and Discovery.
4.     Evaluate potential research questions based upon problems in the leadership domain and distinguish among appropriate methods whereby to address these questions.
5.     Conduct a thorough review of scholarly literature using library and internet search skills.
6.     Critique research studies using skills of critical-analytic thinking.

Course Schedule
Day 0 — Pre-Course Study Tasks

Because of the intensive nature of a two week course, it is highly recommended that you have skimmed through the course texts read prior to coming to class.  The two course texts will be utilized primarily as reference resources, so it is more important that you understand the layout more so than the detailed content. Also, it is highly recommended that you begin thinking about the first assignment, your personal reflection on the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) and the Hogan Personality Inventory (HPI) as soon as the results become available to you.

Day 1 — Learning Integration Project (LIP) Introduction and Introduction to Research

We will set the stage for our work in LDRS 591 by first looking to the reason the course LDRS 591 even exists:  to support the program capstone, the Learning Integration Project (LDRS 697/698). A comprehensive orientation will be provided to all aspects of the LIP. 

In the second half of the day we will provide an introduction to the course, familiarizing you with foundational concepts related to scholarly inquiry. In particular, we will focus on our thinking about what scholarship, research, and evidence-based “best practices” leadership look like. We will then look at research generally and focus on the importance of the questions that drive research generally, and begin to articulate individually the research interests that drive you in your professional life.

Day 2 — Accessing Scholarly Literature

Today we will focus on gaining familiarity with various genres of scholarly literature, getting a sense of how these genres contribute to your own scholarly endeavors, and in gaining first-hand experience in locating and organizing relevant scholarly literature.  Two of the major assignments in this course, and indeed, a major element of LDRS 697/698, hinge on your ability to conduct a review of precedent literature.   We will break this formidable task down into two assignments that build on each other.   Assignment #2 will focus on locating and organizing appropriate literature, and Assignment #3 will focus on your synthesis of the literature you located for Assignment #2.  Although these assignments will not come due until the later in this course, our work today is the foundation for those assignments.

Day 4 — Introductions of Research Reports

Today we will focus on the understanding the elements commonly found in the introductions of research reports.  We will be engaging with the research problem, the review of precedent literature, and the research purpose.  Although the terms “research problem” and “research purpose” sound similar, we will see that although related, are quite different.

Day 5 — Methods and Results of Quantitative Research Reports

Yesterday we explored the introductions to research reports we saw that the research problem establishes why a particular research study is worth doing, the review of precedent literature establishes what is already known about the problem, and the research purpose establishes what the research specifically intends to do.  Today we want to extend this to the next major section of a research report:  The methods and results.  Because of the great differences in quantitative and qualitative methods, we will break this discussion into two days.  Day 5 will focus on the methods and results of quantitative research reports, while Day 6 will focus on those of qualitative research reports.

Day 6 — Methods and Results of Qualitative Research Reports
Today we continue our overview of the most common research methods used in leadership research.  Remember that the purpose of these overviews is that you will be a more informed consumer of research and a practitioner of evidence-based leadership practices.

Earlier when we explored the introductions to research reports we saw that the research problem establishes why a particular research study is worth doing, the review of precedent literature establishes what is already known about the problem, and the research purpose establishes what the research specifically intends to do.  Today we want to continue to extend this to the next major section of a research report:  The methods and results.  Because of the great differences in quantitative and qualitative methods, we have broken this discussion into two days.

Day 7 — Conclusions of Research Reports; Mixed Methods 

Today we will focus on assessing and interpreting the conclusion section of quantitative and qualitative research. Also, we will explore two additional approaches to research that you will commonly encounter.  The mixed methods approach has evolved as a way to utilize the strengths of both qualitative and quantitative research as a particular question is investigated.

Day 8 — Action Research
We want to shift our focus from the highly theoretical and rigidly structured forms of formal research that we have considered this far and to look at a form of research that you are more likely to employ as a leader—action research. Action research has evolved as a method well suited to leadership and organizational studies as well as in educational settings. Today we will explore how action research is related to and yet distinct from the other forms of research we have explored to date.  If formal research approaches (qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods) are aimed at generating new knowledge, action research is aimed at finding solutions to local problems and issues. We will extend our discussion of action research and explore a widely utilized form of action research known as appreciative inquiry (AI). Arising from organizational development studies, AI has found application in a wide range of settings.

Day 9 — Bringing It All Together
 Scholarly research reports can have profound impact on society.  Thus far in this course we have been making the case that best practices are informed by the wise and judicious application of research findings to particular situations.  Don’t miss the importance of adverbs “wise” and “judicious.”  Plano-Clark and Creswell tell us that we should “read research to learn new knowledge about topics, to become informed on policy debates, and to find suggestions for improving your practice” (2010, p. 15).  

The process of bringing things together will utilize several experiential learning exercises, where we join together in (a) passing judgment on the relative merit of a selection of recently published journal articles, (b) we grapple with a fairly recent report that presented conclusions that have had far reaching impact around the world, (c) we wrestle with the real-world consequences to people that motivate us to "get it right".

Style and language usage with weaknesses (e.g., clarity, coherence, grammar). Overall quality shows noticeable deficiencies.
C
<70
2.0
Unacceptable work at graduate level. Shows lack of understanding and/or competence in several of the criteria described above. This grade is a failing grade at the graduate level, and students receiving a “C” course grade are required to re-take the course.
*Note: a grade of “B-“carries a GPA of 2.7; learners require a composite GPA of 3.0 to graduate.
Other Designated Grades
INC = Incomplete. A grade may be incomplete if assignments remain outstanding in a course or if the instructor has not yet submitted a grade. If assignments remain outstanding at the end of a course, students must obtain and complete an incomplete grade form from Enrollment Services.
W = Withdrew. This grade is assigned for students withdrawing during the first half of the course.
WP /WF = Withdrew passing / Withdrew failing. These grades are assigned to students withdrawing during the second half of a course. Grades are not computed into the cumulative GPA. A student may withdraw from a course only because of severe extenuating circumstances and if approval is granted by the Program Director and the Dean of Graduate Studies.

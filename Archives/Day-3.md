 Class Announcement: Transition & New Focus
Today we are introduced to APA 6 as the preferred format for scholarly writing at TWU.  

APA Style

An essential attribute of scholarly work is that of writing well.  Writing well involves several components.  Some are more conceptual—reasoning and developing a logical argument.  Others reflect the mechanics of good written communication—organization of a manuscript, style and language use, grammar, spelling, and punctuation.  APA formatting also falls within this category of the mechanics of writing well.

This program uses the APA Manual (6th edition) as the model for formatting written work formally submitted.  Today is devoted to helping you become familiar with some of the more comment elements of APA style.  In addition to the APA Manual (6th edition), you will find links to a variety of on-line resources posted in MyCourses.

Read pages 3-86 in the APA Manual (6th edition) for an overview of scholarly writing, and pages 87-114 and 169-189 for further formatting specifics.  

You will find a sample document in APA 6 format beginning on page 480 of Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015). Also, on MyCourses I have provided you with a sample paper done in APA 6 format for your reference.  My advice is that you either create a document template with APA 6 fonts and spacing or create a style in MS Word for your ready use.  Various other links are provided including links to the APA publisher’s website and links to Dr. Able Scribe’s (you have to love that name!) helpful websites.  Dr. Scribe’s APA Lite site includes a downloadable PDF that you may find handy.

A.  Course Introduction

Welcome to LDRS 591:  Scholarly Inquiry.  The course introduces you to a fundamental component of graduate work – disciplined scholarship.  Graduate education is rooted in a strong tradition of research and scholarly endeavor that includes exploration, creative conceptualization, and systematic inquiry.

This course has been developed in response to feedback from students and faculty in the MA in Leadership program who have recognized the need for further preparation around scholarly inquiry and research methods before initiating LDRS 697/698.  To meet this clearly identified need, the course provides an overview of: the research process, the activity of critical analyses, and associated skills required for scholarship and research.  It is the main prerequisite for the culminating activity of the MA in Leadership program, LDRS 697/698. 
 
LDRS 591 is positioned in the first year of your program to strengthen your analytical and writing skills; it will benefit you in your remaining course work.  The course aims to equip you as a scholar-practitioner.  

By now you are well aware of the applied nature of the MA in Leadership program.  This feature may be an important part of what attracted you to the program!  Why then study research methods?  Why worry about scholarly inquiry?  This course in research methods/scholarly inquiry helps you to develop systematic thinking skills applicable in all realms of leadership and everyday life.  As Plano-Clark & Creswell note, research adds to your professional knowledge, informs your position in policy debates, and contributes to the improvement in your practice (2010, pp. 4-5).  Moreover, our leadership practice is ideally evidence-based; that is, based on evidence derived from systematic scholarly inquiry.  

A cautionary note:  This course is not intended as a research methods course that will develop advanced or even intermediate skills in empirical investigation in quantitative and qualitative methods.  Rather, the course provides an introductory “toolkit” that will support your work on your applied MA in Leadership activities in LDRS 697/698 and in your further professional work.  The course focuses on identifying the skills of academic writing and retrieval and critical appraisal of scholarly literature.  Its aim is to equip you to be a knowledgeable and critical consumer of scholarly literature in general and research in particular.

The course has been developed around several key ideas:
•	As with other MA in Leadership courses, the onus for learning in this course is on you. What does this mean? Simply stated, the benefit that comes to you will be directly related to your personal level of engagement. 
•	This course has been re-framed to fit a ten-day face to face delivery.  Consequently, it is vital that the assigned pre-reading be completed before you arrive.
•	The course builds a community of scholarship. If you haven’t already done so, visit the Virtual Collegium now to post a note to introduce yourself.
•	The course links directly to your LDRS 697/698 MyCourses site:
- Learning activities include writing exercises that will help you to develop proficiency in writing for an academic context.  
- Course content includes basic elements of research and inquiry for focused application in LDRS 697/698, including foundational content about what is involved in completing LDRS 697/698.

A Note about Learning Resources.  The textbook Understanding Research by Plano-Clark & Creswell serves as a primary resource for this course.  The authors explicitly state their purpose: “The goal of  this book to help you learn how to read and make sense of research reports” (Plano-Clark & Creswell, 2015, p. 3).  Another attractive feature of the text is its interdisciplinary approach, complementing MA in Leadership’s interdisciplinary program.  

The second text for the course is the APA Manual Sixth Edition, 4th printing (Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association). Notice that the 4th printing is significant.  Previous printings had numerous errors that were corrected in this printing.  You will use this resource extensively as a reference in the writing and formatting of program assignments and LDRS 697/698 components.  You will find some sections more applicable to your work than others, i.e. you will need to learn thoroughly the material on citations, and references and possibly less probably to aspects such as table design.

Goals of LDRS/MAEL 697/698 

The LDRS/MAEL 697/698 is the capstone of the Master of Arts in Leadership program.  This course is the vehicle upon which your personal Leadership Competency Development will be framed and documented.
The purpose of LDRS 697/698 is to encourage learners to integrate their learning in the Master of Arts in Leadership and the Master of Arts in Educational Leadership programs and apply the curriculum themes of:
1)	Transformational servant leadership
2)	Values based leadership
3)	 Leadership ethics

The process of designing and completing LDRS 697/698 itself is part of the higher order learning process.  LDRS 697/698 is focused on integrating the learning from various courses into a more comprehensive understanding of leadership. Courses will be collectively analyzed and re-evaluated to determine meta-themes to inform a deeper level of scholarly inquiry in the field of leadership.  Furthermore, LDRS 697/698 will ensure that each student is focused on an individualized educational plan as he navigates through each course and learning experience. 
LDRS 697/698 consists of three credit hours of work, and represents the final demonstration of a student’s ability to integrate practical program curriculum content and demonstration of MA Lead’s defined leadership competencies: Visioning and Strategic Thinking; Adaptability and Change; Results; Team Leadership; People Development; Innovation; Values and Ethics; Service & Quality Orientation; Relationships & Collaboration; Planning & Organizing; Higher Ordered Analysis
You will document your implementation of the goals of LDRS 697/698 through your completion of a series of elements largely negotiated between yourself and your advisor which demonstrate your personal leadership development and value added to employers.  LDRS 697/698 requires competent use of evidence-based scholarly knowledge, ability to analyze an issue, discipline in the problem-solving process, and scholarly documentation and presentation of information.
LDRS/MAEL 697/698 Processes- Praxis
 
Glanz has described an action research cycle as consisting of six steps:  selecting of a focus, followed by data collection, then data analysis and interpretation, then action based on the data analysis, followed by reflection and then either continuing with or modification of the action, all leading back to the selection of a new focus (Glanz, 1998, p. 27).   At that time, I suggested that the cycles of action research as described by Glanz share a great deal of conceptual overlap with the process known as “praxis.”

Praxis is a transliteration of a Greek word that is focused on both doing and planning (Kittel, Bromiley & Freidreich 1964-1976, p. 632).  A number of prominent educators have adapted this word to educational use.  Widely known for his emphasis on praxis, the Brazilian educator Paulo Freire conceives of praxis as action and reflection (2006, p. 94).  He asserts that humans are marked by the results of their actions.  In acting they transform, and in transforming they create an environment that conditions their acting.  Praxis hinges on dialogue that demands the problematic confrontation of knowledge “with the concrete reality in which it is engendered, and on which it acts, in order to better understand, explain, and transform that reality” (Freire 2006,  p. 111).  
There is consensus among adult educators that adults learn best by doing.  Jane Vella defines praxis as “learning by doing” with “built in reflection”, and includes it as one of her twelve keystones to effective adult learning (1995, p. 33).   To Vella, praxis is a kind of dance between inductive and deductive forms of learning, and involves cycles of doing, reflecting, deciding, changing, and new doing.  To the African educator Gichia, praxis is a rhythm between action and reflection, and then further action informed by the reflection (1989, pp. 98-99).
By way of illustrating how praxis works, Ted Ward (n.d.) has suggested a rail fence analogy to describe the education of professionals such as you.   The elements of his analogy may be diagrammed as follows.




 






 

   

                              Figure 1.  Adapted from Ward (n.d.).


The upper rail is labeled “theory” and refers to cognitive inputs that are part of every educational program.  Ward asserts that cognitive input is basic to competence and excellence.  In the MA in Leadership program, there are a great many cognitive inputs that come to you through a wide range of instructional modes.   
The lower rail is labeled “experience.”  Here, experience refers primarily to your personal and professional experiences in life.  Your experiences have no doubt contributed greatly to your learning, including the development of knowledge, the basis for evaluation, and your motivation to continue to learn.
As Ward conceived this model, the upright posts in the fence denoted the places where the learner is able to make a solid connection between theory and practice.  To Ward, the seminar is where the learner has opportunity for the learner to reflect, evaluate and hypothesize as theory and practice are connected.  A good seminar is characterized by making provision for and stimulation to reflect upon and evaluate learnings from both the cognitive inputs of theory and personal experience (Ward, n.d.).
The Master of Arts in Leadership program is structured in such a way that Ward’s conception of seminars is accomplished throughout the core and stream courses taken and finally in LDRS 697/698 (Leadership Integration Project).  The Leadership Integration Project is intended to be the tangible result of the praxis you engage in where the theory you encounter in the program courses intersects with your experience.  Ideally, your Leadership Integration Project is a report of the action research you have conducted to further your personal professional practice.  Your LDRS 697/698 advisor who will be assigned to you following your completion of LDRS 591 will serve as a fellow-traveler along this path of learning. 

LDRS/MAEL  697/698  Processes- Selection of Focus Leadership Competencies

In LDRS 697/698 you will, through praxis, propose and implement a Leadership Integration Project that integrates knowledge and experiences gained in the MA Lead program.  In this, you will assemble together diverse aspects of leadership into a focused whole using Boyer’s model of scholarship. The relationship might be depicted in this way.


















Boyer’s Scholarships of Application and Integration will most likely but not necessarily primary as you address LDRS/MAEL 697/698.

To Do:  If you haven’t already done so, download and read the LDRS 697/698 Learner’s Manual from MyCourses.   As well, download and read the supplemental documents (Boyer’s Model of Scholarship, and Bloom’s Taxonomy Unpacked) and the MA in Leadership monographs provided to you at orientation.

Boyer’s Model of Scholarship

LDRS/MAEL 697/698 is the capstone individual product of the MA in Leadership program.  In LDRS/MAEL 697/698 through completing the activities you will have opportunity to integrate your learning in the MA in Leadership program and bring together diverse servant leadership practice into a focused whole using higher order thinking skills. LDRS 697/698 is the application of servant leadership theory to your workplace in a scholarly project.  Because this is intended to be a scholarly work, as a “necessary evil” you will need to become proficient in writing in conformance to APA 6 format. The assignment in Day 2 is designed to help you along that road. 

MA in Leadership’s guidelines for LDRS 697/698 draws in part from Boyer’s four-part Model of Scholarship.  Boyer’s typology identifies four domains of scholarship: discovery, integration, application, and teaching.  The model is discussed by Marta Nibert (n.d.)in her paper titled Boyer’s Model of Scholarship. In the section titled Application she notes that the

scholarship of application focuses on using research findings and innovations to remedy societal problems. Included are  . . . service activities . . . specifically tied to one’s field of knowledge and professional activities. Beneficiaries . . . include commercial entities, non-profit organizations, and professional associations. 

Though Nibert’s primary audience is the professoriate, this material is relevant for MA in Leadership candidates.  Following is a chart that depicts the four domains of scholarship in Boyer’s typology.  Application is highlighted because the Master of Arts in Leadership was designed to focus primarily on the scholarship of application, although your work in LDRS 697/698 will likely include one or more of the other domains.  One of the major assignments for this course will take you into the scholarship of integration.  If you have glanced through the 591 Graded Activities document, you should have no trouble identifying that assignment.

Boyer’s Model of the Scholarship of Teaching

Type of Scholarship
Purpose
Measures of Performance
Discovery
Build new knowledge through traditional research. 
•	Publishing in peer-reviewed forums 
•	Producing and/or performing creative work within established field 
•	Creating infrastructure for future studies 
Integration
Interpret the use of knowledge across disciplines. 
•	Preparing a comprehensive literature review 
•	Writing a textbook for use in multiple disciplines 
•	Collaborating with colleagues to design and deliver a core course 
Application
Aid society and professions in addressing problems. 
•	Serving industry or government as an external consultant 
•	Assuming leadership roles in professional organizations 
•	Advising student leaders, thereby fostering their professional growth 
Teaching 
Study teaching models and practices to achieve optimal   learning. 
•	Advancing learning theory through classroom research 
•	Developing and testing instructional materials 
•	Mentoring graduate students 
•	Designing and implementing a program-level assessment system 

Boyer’s Scholarship of Discovery is the type of scholarship associated with traditional scholarly research.  “Research is a systematic process of collecting, analyzing and interpreting information (data) in order to increase our understanding of a phenomenon abut which we are interested or concerned” (Leedy & Ormrod2010, p. 2).  Boyer’s Scholarship of Discovery is often referred to as primary research.  Primary research is narrowly focused, and contributes to the body of knowledge by helping us to understand one isolated part of reality in detail in the hopes that this understanding can by generalized to some degree to a broader part of reality.

Boyer’s Scholarship of Integration is “the attempt to arrange relevant bits of knowledge and insight from different disciplines into broader patterns that reflect the actual interconnectedness of the world” (Boyer cited in Jacobsen & Jacobsen 2004, p. 51).  Scholarship of Integration often demands interdisciplinary collaboration and requires that the critical analysis and review of knowledge be followed by the creative synthesis of views and insights in such a way that what is known speaks to specific topics or issues.

The Scholarship of Application is “the scholarship of engagement; seeking to close the gap between values in the academy and the needs of the larger world” (Boyer cited in Jacobsen & Jacobsen 2004, p. 51).  In the Scholarship of Application, knowledge is applied to the solution of societal needs and practice.  In most cases, knowledge stemming from the Scholarship of Discovery and the Scholarship of Integration informs the solutions to particular problems.  The Scholarships of Discovery and Integration are often associated with the context of formal education.  The Scholarship of Application may happen within formal education contexts, it is most often associated with other settings (Bosher 2009, p. 6).  

Finally, the Scholarship of Teaching is “the scholarship of sharing knowledge” (Boyer cited in Jacobsen & Jacobsen 2004, p. 51).  The Scholarship of Teaching involves the reflective analysis of the knowledge about teaching and learning.  This knowledge base itself is the product of the Scholarships of Discovery, Integration and Application combining as “active ingredients of a dynamic and iterative teaching process” (Bosher 2009, p. 5). 

Boyer’s typology originally identified as the Scholarship of Teaching has been expanded somewhat and is widely known today in the literature as the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (Bosher 2009).  You have undoubtedly already notice an ambiguity:  If the entire model is called the Scholarship of Teaching, how is it that the last element depicted in the chart above is also called the Scholarship of Teaching?  This ambiguity is evidence, Bosher contends that Boyer’s four domains were conceived holistically as elements that overlap and interact, not as discrete elements, appearing in any predictable order, and are better viewed as an operating system than a list of elements  (2009, pp. 4-5).    

The Scholarship of Discovery (traditional research) falls into two distinct genres:  quantitative research and qualitative research.  Each of these genres manifest in numerous variations, including hybrid models involving both quantitative and qualitative elements, designed for and suited to differing research questions.  Chapter 2 of Plano-Clark and Creswell provides a cogent discussion of these approaches to scholarly research.

Plano-Clark and Creswell provide the background necessary to critique empirical research studies, rather than to guide you in carrying out your own research (scholarship of discovery).  Put another way, you will be learning about various research methods (e.g., quantitative research, qualitative research, and mixed methods) so that you can gain proficiency in becoming a critical consumer of research conducted by others.  The Instructor Notes that forms the basis of each set of Daily Notes will guide you in applying and extending concepts presented in the Plano-Clark and Creswell text.


LDRS 697/698 Platform and Processes

You will be assigned an advisor and a section of LDRS 697/698 on MyCourses.  This will function similarly to other courses wherein you will be able to interact with your advisor as well as upload elements of LDRS 697/698 which document your development of your personal leadership competencies through the Leadership Integration Project.  Your LDRS 697/698 Advisor will be assigned to you shortly after completion of LDRS 591. 

Clarifying Your Research Interest

The Master of Arts in Leadership program values the application of best practices to your personal professional practice.  Before we get into some of the concrete realities of accessing scholarly literature, we need to pause and give time for you to reflect on and articulate some issues that are salient in your personal professional life and practice.  The following questions will begin to guide the process. 

¬	Significant Question:  What are the “significant questions that can be answered empirically” (Gall, Gall & Borg 2007, p. 35) relevant to you in your professional life?  State a research problem in complete, grammatical sentences.  In stating your research problem, consider the following:
•    Is my statement sufficiently broad? Is it clear how the general area of study will be limited or focused?  
•    Does the problem have the potential for providing important and useful answers and information?   
¬	Research Approach: Based on your reading of Plano-Clark & Creswell, do you think your problem statement lends itself more to qualitative or quantitative research (for data-based approaches) or to more conceptual research reports?  Defend your position.
¬	Literature Review: What broad fields of social science do you anticipate might inform your problem statement?  What key words would you begin to with as you conduct a literature search?
¬	Purpose for Research:  Working with Plano-Clark & Creswell’s definition of research purpose, suggest some focused questions that will serve to guide your upcoming review of precedent literature.

COURSE DESCRIPTION
LDRS 591 provides an overview of the process, critical analysis, and associated skills required for scholarship and research.  This course is designed for learners who may have little experience in the area of research, and will provide introduction to scholarly inquiry and various research approaches being used in the field of leadership to the end that learners may become discriminating consumers of research.  Course themes include focus on APA formatting, location and evaluation of scholarly literature, and processes leading to the creation of a graduate level synthetic review of precedent literature.  The course combines theoretical/conceptual understandings with applied practice, and is challenging for most learners.

COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES
On completing this course, students should be able to:

1.     Appraise and evaluate the research process based upon the values and ethical standards of servant leadership.
2.     Demonstrate critical thinking and analytic skills characteristic of a rigorous   approach to scholarship.
3.     Distinguish between Boyer’s Scholarship of Application, Integration, Teaching, and Discovery.
4.     Evaluate potential research questions based upon problems in the leadership domain and distinguish among appropriate methods whereby to address these questions.
5.     Conduct a thorough review of scholarly literature using library and internet search skills.
6.     Critique research studies using skills of critical-analytic thinking. 


STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES
 The course learning outcomes are aligned to the upper three domains of Bloom’s and Fink’s Taxonomy as well as TWU Student Learning Outcomes (SLO). The course learning outcomes are framed in terms consistent with the upper three domains of Bloom’s taxonomy. It is assumed that as learners encounter new material, the lower three categories of remembering, understanding and applying will be ongoing and provide the foundation to engage in the upper three domains.  Bloom’s taxonomy is a useful frame to operationalize the elements of foundational knowledge, application and integration in Fink’s Taxonomy of Significant Learning.  Course learning outcomes align as follows:

GRADING SYSTEM
TWU’s standard grading system may be found in the academic calendar for the current year.  
In an effort to ensure consistency in the MALEAD/MAEL assignment of grades and to inform graduate students of assessments of the quality of work at the graduate level, the following interpretation of grades in assignments and courses offers a guideline.

Letter Grade
%
Grade
Point
Value
Meaning in Graduate Work Note: For assignments that meet criteria in several categories, instructors will assign an average grade.

95-100
4.3
Exceptionally well-reasoned, compelling development of position. Outstanding incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Strikingly appropriate examples. Extraordinary insight, critical analytical and evaluative ability, and creativity. Superlative style and language usage. Makes an original contribution and is potentially publishable.
A
90-94
4.0
Well-argued and convincing development of position. Insightful incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Notably appropriate examples. Excellent insight, critical analytic and evaluative ability, and creativity. Impressive style and language use.
A-
85-89
3.7
Thorough and plausible development of position. Skillful incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Very good examples. Very good insight, analytic and evaluative ability, and creativity. Commendable and fluent style and language usage.
B+
80-84

Competent development of position, but possibly with some gaps and/or limitations. Satisfactory incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Satisfactory examples. Reasonable insight, analytic and evaluative ability. Little creativity. Generally satisfactory style and language usage, but possibly with some minor flaws.
B-
70-74
2.7*
Unimpressive development of position. Position not completely consistent with personal vision or references and resources not taken fully into account or examples are basic or not completely convincing or lacking acceptable insight and analytic and evaluative ability. Style and language usage with weaknesses (e.g., clarity, coherence, grammar). Overall quality shows noticeable deficiencies.
C
<70
2.0
Unacceptable work at graduate level. Shows lack of understanding and/or competence in several of the criteria described above. This grade is a failing grade at the graduate level, and students receiving a “C” course grade are required to re-take the course.
*Note: a grade of “B-“carries a GPA of 2.7; learners require a composite GPA of 3.0 to graduate.
Other Designated Grades
INC = Incomplete. A grade may be incomplete if assignments remain outstanding in a course or if the instructor has not yet submitted a grade. If assignments remain outstanding at the end of a course, students must obtain and complete an incomplete grade form from Enrollment Services.
W = Withdrew. This grade is assigned for students withdrawing during the first half of the course.
WP /WF = Withdrew passing / Withdrew failing. These grades are assigned to students withdrawing during the second half of a course. Grades are not computed into the cumulative GPA. A student may withdraw from a course only because of severe extenuating circumstances and if approval is granted by the Program Director and the Dean of Graduate Studies.

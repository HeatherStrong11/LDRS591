### Introduction to Quantitative and Qualitative Research Design

By now you should be familiar with the terms quantitative research and qualitative research.  Plano-Clark and Creswell \(2010\) assert that these research approaches are suited to different kinds of research questions:  a quantitative research approach is indicated when the research problem requires an explanation, while a qualitative research approach is indicated when the research problem requires exploration \(pp. 85-86\).  Expanding on that somewhat, Leedy and Ormrod assert that quantitative research has three purposes:  to explain and predict, to confirm and validate, and to test theory.  In contrast, qualitative research has three distinct purposes:  to describe and explain, to explore and interpret, and to build theory \(Leedy & Ormrod, 2010, p. 96\).  These differing research purposes find expression in differing research processes, the kinds of data gathered, the approaches to data analysis, and finally in the ways findings are communicated.

Today we will be looking at the methods and results sections of quantitative research reports, and in unit 6 we will do the same for qualitative research reports.  In the process, we will see that a large number of research designs are described in the methods sections of reports of research conducted under both of these general approaches.

Within these two broad approaches to research are a large number of designs that show emphasis on a number of differing elements.  Gill and Johnson \(2002\) have developed a helpful continuum \(depicted in the figure below\) that describes the relative emphasis of various research designs on selected characteristics.  They argue that quantitative designs \(including survey research\) tend towards deduction while qualitative designs are inductive in nature.

Quantitative designs tend to be more closely focused on a problem that has known variables that can be controlled or at least accounted for.  The investigation is conducted following established guidelines utilizing largely predetermined methods while the researcher seeks to maintain a detached view.  In contrast, qualitative designs tend to be more holistic, investigating unknown variables following flexible guidelines utilizing emergent methods in a highly context-bound, personal approach.  Qualitative designs may be characterized as evolving and flexible, sometimes guided by a general hunch as to how to proceed \(Bogdan & Biklen, 2007, p. 45\).

These differing designs lead to marked differences in what data are collected, how data are collected, and how data are analyzed.  Quantitative research seeks to collect numeric data from as large a sample as possible so to enhance claims to being representative, using standardized data collection instruments.  Qualitative research gathers textual or image-based data from typically small, informative samples using loosely structured or nonstandardized interviews or observations \(Leedy & Ormrod, 2010, p. 96\).

The differing designs of quantitative and qualitative research also lead marked differences in how data collected is analyzed.  Quantitative data is approached primarily through deductive reasoning, employing statistical analyses applied to numerical data, with stress on objectivity.  Qualitative data is approached primarily through inductive reasoning with the goal uncovering themes and categories, with acknowledgement of potential researcher bias and subjectivity.  Typically, quantitative research findings are reported in a formal, scientific style with full display of numbers and statistics, while qualitative research findings are typically reported in a narrative form \(Leedy & Ormrod, 2010, p. 96\).  In the following pages, we will unpack this somewhat for quantitative research.

### Quantitative Research Designs

Quantitative research designs typically rely on theoretical frameworks in choosing the concepts to be investigated, the suggestion of research questions, and the framing of research findings \(Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p. 39\).  These frameworks lead to a structured, predetermined, formal, and specifically detailed plan of operation \(Bogdan & Biklen, 2007, p. 45\).

In Chapter 6, Plano-Clark and Creswell \(2015\) discuss five quantitative research designs: true experiments, quasi-experiment, single-subject, correlational and survey research designs.  Take note of where three of these are situated in Gill and Johnson’s continuum above. The extreme left of the continuum is held by experiments.  Experiments—particularly randomized control trials \(RCTs\)—are often held up as the “gold standard” of research, meeting the criteria of randomization, control, and manipulation of variables \(i.e., experimental procedures, treatments, or interventions\).   In the domain of knowledge transfer and evidence-based practice, RCTs are considered as the highest level or most reliable form of evidence.

By way of caution, Gill and Johnson \(2002\) observe that except as it borders the disciplinary areas of psychology and information systems, management and leadership research seldom employs classical experimentation. They posit that this is because true experiments are difficult to conduct in natural everyday settings, due to the difficulty of maintaining the tight controls required for experimental research. Having said this, there is relevance for us because the logic underpinning experimental research applies to other types of deductive research that are more common in management and leadership research.  When not all of the rigorous standards required of experiments can be applied to a study, researchers approximate some of the logic of the experiment with quasi-experiments or ex-post facto designs.

Quasi-experimental designs resemble experimental designs in that they include manipulation of an independent variable but differ in that they lack either a control group or random assignment.  Ex-post facto designs do not involve experimentation \(i.e, manipulation of the independent variable\) but observe the effects of manipulating the independent variable after it has occurred.

Gall, Gall and Borg \(2007\) recognize two main categories, non-experimental and experimental, of quantitative research design, demarked by the degree of researcher intervention.  In true experimental and quasi-experimental designs, the researcher intentionally introduces an intervention, and then seeks to measure the response to that intervention.  The main difference between experimental and quasi-experimental designs lies in the way sampling is done.  In non-experimental quantitative research designs, the researcher seeks to understand the behavior or attributes of the study sample without any researcher intervention.  The terms descriptive, causal-comparative and correlational are often applied to these types of quantitative research designs.

A descriptive research strategy is employed when the researcher wants to create a “detailed, quantitatively based description of a phenomenon” \(p. 297\).  Descriptive research examines a situation as it is rather than manipulating variables or intervening in the phenomena \(as would be the case in quasi- or experimental research\).  In causal-comparative designs the researcher forms at least two groups and compares them with the goal of identifying possible causes or effects of a phenomenon.  Correlational research design is similar to causal-comparative research but differs in the approach to sampling, measurement and statistical analysis of data \(Gall, Gall & Borg, 2007, p. 297\).

As a consumer of research reports, you can usually find in the abstract or the early part of a research report an indication of what research methodology is employed by the study.  This is important information for you to identify, as you will quickly develop a sense of what to expect as you continue to read.  This sense is important as you critique the research report, and make value judgments as to it’s worth.

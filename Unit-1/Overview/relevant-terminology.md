### Relevant Terminology

By now you may have noticed what seemed like differences in usage among the terms “research,” “scholarship,” and “scholarly inquiry.”  In this course we will use these terms as follows:

**Scholarship:** The application of systematic approaches to the acquisition of knowledge through intellectual inquiry \(used interchangeably with “scholarly inquiry”\).

**Scholarly:**

1\) concerned with academic study, especially research,   
2\) exhibiting the methods and attitudes of a scholar, and   
3\) having the manner and appearance of a scholar.

**Research:** “At a general level, research consists of three steps:  
1\)    Posing a question.  
2\)    Collecting data to answer the question.  
3\)    Presenting an answer to the question \(Plano-Clark & Creswell, 2010, p.4\).” Research generates “new” knowledge.

Scholarship once was defined narrowly in terms of empirical or scientific research.  More recently the academic community has moved toward a broader conceptualization of scholarship more in keeping with knowledge acquisition and application through a variety of avenues.  

You may also be wondering: How does the research process differ from managerial activities such as decision-making and problem solving?  Research shares with decision-making and problem-solving the systematic and disciplined procedure of identifying an issue/problem, deciding on an approach, formulating a plan, collecting and analyzing data, drawing conclusions and implementing decisions based on this rigorous process.  What distinguishes research from generic or everyday problem solving is its commitment to advance or generate knowledge that typically will be communicated to the larger academic or scientific community.

##### Clarifying terminology

Students often talk about “researching a term paper;” leaders may speak of “researching a problem.” How do we understand the term “research”? In this course we use the term research in a particular \(arguably in a “purist”\) way to refer to empirical inquiry \(what Boyer refers to the “scholarship of discovery”\).  This distinction will be revisited throughout the course, emphasizing that while we are learning about research methods, your aim in LDRS 697/698 is not to generate new knowledge \(i.e., to conduct research\), but rather to demonstrate your application of leadership theory to a particular practice situation.

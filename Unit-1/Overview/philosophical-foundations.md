### What is inquiry?

Inquiry is “the process of developing skills to arrive at understandings of a problem, an issue, or a phenomenon, through the process of asking good questions, searching out good evidence, and arriving at well-reasoned conclusions" \(Penner, 2017\).

By now you are well aware of the applied nature of the MA in Leadership program. This feature may be an important part of what attracted you to the program! Why then study research methods? Why worry about scholarly inquiry? This course in scholarly inquiry helps you to develop systematic thinking skills applicable in all realms of leadership and everyday life. As Plano-Clark & Creswell note, research adds to your professional knowledge, informs your position in policy debates, and contributes to the improvement in your practice \(2015, pp. 4-5\). Moreover, our leadership practice is ideally evidence-based; that is, based on evidence derived from systematic scholarly inquiry.

### Three Foundational Questions

A professor of mine often observed that a fundamental attribute of being human is to ask questions.  Humanity is especially interested in three fundamental questions: What is real?  What is true?  What is good?   The philosophical category of metaphysics is concerned with what is real, and what is the nature of reality.  The philosophical category of epistemology is concerned with what is true, and what is the nature and process of knowing, and axiology is concerned with what is good, and how we can determine the nature of goodness.  Much of history is a chronicle of the different ways people have answered these three fundamental questions.  How we answer these questions reveals our perspective or our worldview.

A worldview is "an interpretive framework through which one makes sense of themselves, other people, and the world around them" \(Geisler & Watkins, 2003\).  It is like a pair of glasses that you wear when you are observing things about yourself, other people and the world in which you live.  It is important to be aware of what your worldview is before you enter into the research journey because it will inform the types of questions that you ask, and also the processes that you use to find the answers to your questions.  As an example let me compare two common worldviews and explain how they can be applied to the research journey.

A Christian worldview states that God has created the world and everything in it and that truth is arrived at through a study of God's specific revelation \(the bible\) and general revelation \(creation\).  The Christian worldview can be summarized in three words: Creation, Fall and Redemption. Initially, when God created the world, it was all good and whole and harmonious. God created man in his own image. Originally, man was created healthy in body, soul and spirit \(Genesis 1:26-27, 31\). As people rebelled against God causing the fall, the presence of sin became like a sickness in the world that has caused much suffering and disease. Where there was harmony and wholeness, we now experience ourselves, our relationships and the world around us as fractured, broken, and full of dis-ease \(a literal discomfort with who we are\) \(Genesis 3\).

Now, despite the brokenness, Christians believe that God is actively working to bring about restoration and wholeness to his entire creation. Through Christ’s redemptive work on the cross, and in our own lives, people are reconciled to God and are challenged to make all things as they were created and meant to be – very good. Redemption means that all things are made new in Christ \(Colossians 1:19-20\).

The framework of Creation, Fall, Redemption is important because it allows us to enter into a discussion about research with confidence knowing that God’s redemptive work touches this area. Christians believe that we are called to study creation with the desire to take the knowledge we gain and use it to help and bless others; to work toward the restoration and healing of God’s creation.  Christians are called to inquire, to investigate, to ask questions, with the purpose of blessing others. 

A secular humanist worldview states that evolutionary theory holds comprehensive explanatory power to account for all that exists.  Truth is arrived at through human reason and scientific understanding.  The secular worldview places man at the center of all things and believes in man’s inherent goodness and predicts that every individual can achieve mental health through the fulfillment of physical or material needs.  man is evil primarily because his cultural and social environments are evil, not through any fault of his own. Humanists believe that science, reason, and historical experience are sufficient guides for figuring out what is right or wrong in any situation.  

So, how do we know what is true?  While this list is not exhaustive, there are three common approaches to knowing:

1\) The rational approach \(focused on logical thought\): the process of taking the bits and pieces of our experience of life and we put it together logically.

2\) The empirical approach \(focused on external evidence\): rests on senses and information gathered by our senses.

3\) The intuitive approach \(focused on insight and inner knowledge\): consists of insight that cannot be rationally explained, but is none-the-less real.

Each of us has an epistemological preference, and manifestations of these preferences abound.

Whichever epistemological preference you have, we are all faced with a similar problem.  It is easy to say, “I know this is true!” when, if we are really honest, we really don’t know.  I want to suggest four processes that we must constantly keep wading through as we test our own knowledge:  
•    Consistency—it has to make logical sense.  
•    Coherency—it has to make sense as a whole.  That is not to say that mystery is disallowed.  
•    Comprehensive—it has to relate to the whole world as I know it.  
•    Congruent \(with reality\)—it has to match what is.

As we get into looking at different research methodologies, we will see that great pains are taken to attend to these four processes.

It is beyond the purpose of this course to go deeper into this other than to make the point that our way of knowing and understanding the world around us \(e.g., our worldview\) influences how we approach all of life, including how we approach research, and how we use research to inform our decision-making process.

### Leadership and Scholarly Inquiry

On what basis are sound decisions made?  What evidence do leaders rely upon for best outcomes?  The need to evaluate the bases or evidence for best practices in leadership decision-making is widely acknowledged.  Patton \(2001\) observes that “the emphasis on knowledge generation disseminated in the form of best practices has swept like wildfire through all sectors of society” \(p. 329\).

We often refer to the vision of best practices in leadership within the MA in Leadership program \(see Kirkham 2004\). What do we mean by this?  Put simply, “best practices” refers to those practices and initiatives that result in the best possible outcomes.  How do we know what best practice is?  The process of identifying best practices begins with an understanding of common sources of evidence available to leaders.

Take a moment to think about a recent decision you made as a leader.  On what did you base this decision?  Previous experience?  Values?  Company policy?  Empirical evidence \(e.g., data derived from research\)?  Expert opinion?

Systematic inquiry \(as represented by research\) is one tool that leaders can use to inform best practices and their decision making process.  Systematic inquiry is hardly new – in first century writings we see in the Bible evidence of systematic, logical, and empirical inquiry.  Consider the following passage from Luke, a physician trained in empirical methods of his day:

1Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled\[a\] among us, 2 just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. 3  With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 4 so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. \(Luke 1:1-4, NIV\)

How does the research process differ from managerial activities such as decision-making and problem solving?  Research shares with decision-making and problem-solving the systematic and disciplined procedure of identifying an issue/problem, deciding on an approach, formulating a plan, collecting and analyzing data, drawing conclusions and implementing decisions based on this rigorous process.  What distinguishes research from generic or everyday problem solving is its commitment to advance or generate knowledge that typically will be communicated to the larger academic or scientific community.

The past two decades have seen remarkable growth within natural and applied sciences and humanities of the articulation of the foundations of research with a corresponding expansion of research methodologies.

### Boyer's Model of Scholarship

Boyer’s Scholarship of** Discovery** is the type of scholarship associated with traditional scholarly research.  “Research is a systematic process of collecting, analyzing and interpreting information \(data\) in order to increase our understanding of a phenomenon about which we are interested or concerned” \(Leedy & Ormrod, 2010, p. 2\).  Boyer’s Scholarship of Discovery is often referred to as primary research.  Primary research is narrowly focused, and contributes to the body of knowledge by helping us to understand one isolated part of reality in detail in the hopes that this understanding can by generalized to some degree to a broader part of reality.

The Scholarship of Discovery \(traditional research\) falls into two distinct genres:  quantitative research and qualitative research.  Each of these genres manifest in numerous variations, including hybrid models involving both quantitative and qualitative elements, designed for and suited to differing research questions.

Boyer’s Scholarship of** Integration** is “the attempt to arrange relevant bits of knowledge and insight from different disciplines into broader patterns that reflect the actual interconnectedness of the world” \(Boyer as cited in Jacobsen & Jacobsen 2004, p. 51\).  Scholarship of Integration often demands interdisciplinary collaboration and requires that the critical analysis and review of knowledge be followed by the creative synthesis of views and insights in such a way that what is known speaks to specific topics or issues.

Boyer's Scholarship of **Application** is “the scholarship of engagement; seeking to close the gap between values in the academy and the needs of the larger world” \(Boyer cited in Jacobsen & Jacobsen 2004, p. 51\).  In the Scholarship of Application, knowledge is applied to the solution of societal needs and practice.  In most cases, knowledge stemming from the Scholarship of Discovery and the Scholarship of Integration informs the solutions to particular problems.  The Scholarships of Discovery and Integration are often associated with the context of formal education \(Bosher 2009, p. 6\).

Finally, Boyer's Scholarship of **Teaching** is “the scholarship of sharing knowledge” \(Boyer cited in Jacobsen & Jacobsen 2004, p. 51\).  The Scholarship of Teaching involves the reflective analysis of the knowledge about teaching and learning.  This knowledge base itself is the product of the Scholarships of Discovery, Integration and Application combining as “active ingredients of a dynamic and iterative teaching process” \(Bosher, 2009, p. 5\).

Boyer’s typology originally identified as the Scholarship of Teaching has been expanded somewhat and is widely known today in the literature as the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning \(Bosher, 2009\).  You have undoubtedly already notice an ambiguity:  If the entire model is called the Scholarship of Teaching, how is it that the last element depicted in the chart above is also called the Scholarship of Teaching?  This ambiguity is evidence, Bosher contends that Boyer’s four domains were conceived holistically as elements that overlap and interact, not as discrete elements, appearing in any predictable order, and are better viewed as an operating system than a list of elements  \(2009, pp. 4-5\).

This course will provide the background necessary to critique empirical research studies, rather than to guide you in carrying out your own research \(scholarship of discovery\).  Put another way, you will be learning about various research methods \(e.g., quantitative research, qualitative research, and mixed methods\) so that you can gain proficiency in becoming a critical consumer of research.

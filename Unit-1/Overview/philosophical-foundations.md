### Three Foundational Questions

A professor of mine often observed that a fundamental attribute of being human is to ask questions.  Humanity is especially interested in three fundamental questions: What is real?  What is true?  What is good?   The philosophical category of metaphysics is concerned with what is real, and what is the nature of reality.  The philosophical category of epistemology is concerned with what is true, and what is the nature and process of knowing, and axiology is concerned with what is good, and how we can determine the nature of goodness.  Much of history is a chronicle of the different ways people have answered these three fundamental questions.  How we answer these questions reveals our perspective or our worldview.  

A worldview is "an interpretive framework through which one makes sense of themselves, other people, and the world around them" \(Geisler & Watkins, 1989\).  It is like a pair of glasses that you wear when you are observing things about yourself, other people and the world in which you live.  It is important to understand what your personal worldview is before you jump into the research journey because it will inform the types of questions that you ask and also the processes that you use to obtain what you believe to be truth.

So, how do we know what is true?  While this list is not exhaustive, we see around us three common approaches to knowing—the rational approach \(focused on logical thought\), the empirical approach \(focused on external evidence\) and the intuitive approach \(focused on insight and inner knowledge\).   Rational knowing \(what we will call “cognitive constructivist” below\) is the process of taking the bits and pieces of our experience of life and we put it together logically.  Empirical knowing rests on senses and information gathered by our senses.  Intuitive knowing consists of insight that cannot be rationally explained, but is none-the-less real.  Each of us has an epistemological preference, and manifestations of these preferences abound. 

Whichever epistemological preference one has, we are all faced with a similar problem.  It is easy to say, “I know this is true!” when, if we are really honest, we really don’t know.  I want to suggest four processes that we must constantly keep wading through as we test our own knowledge:  
•    Consistency—it has to make logical sense.  
•    Coherency—it has to make sense as a whole.  That is not to say that mystery is disallowed.  
•    Comprehensive—it has to relate to the whole world as I know it.  
•    Congruent \(with reality\)—it has to match what is.

As we get into looking at different research methodologies, we will see that great pains are taken to attend to these four processes.  

It is beyond our purpose do go much more deeply into this other than to make the point that our basic philosophical bases influence our approach to all of life, including how we approach research.  

Quantitative and Qualitative Research Methodologies  
Systematic inquiry \(as represented by research\) is hardly new – in first century writings we see in the Bible evidence of systematic, logical, and empirical inquiry.  Consider the following passage from Luke, a physician trained in empirical methods of his day:

1Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled\[a\] among us, 2 just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. 3  With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 4 so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. \(Luke 1:1-4, NIV\)

The past two decades have seen remarkable growth within natural and applied sciences and humanities of the articulation of the foundations of research with a corresponding expansion of research methodologies.

Chapter 2 on Plano-Clark and Creswell \(2015\) provides an excellent discussion of the distinguishing features of quantitative and qualitative research methodologies.  I wish here only to underscore these salient points:  quantitative research is indicated by “a problem that calls for an explanation” and responds to narrow, focused questions by collecting quantifiable data which through statistical analysis, yields unbiased, objective results \(Plano-Clark & Creswell, 2015, p. 54\).  Qualitative research is indicated by “a problem that calls for an exploration,” and responds to broad, general questions by collecting non-quantifiable data which is described and analyzed “in a subjective and reflexive manner” \(p. 54\).

Contrary to Plano-Clark and Creswell, I want to suggest that the term “unbiased” as a descriptor of both qualitative and quantitative research.  As we get into this more deeply, you will see why I do that.  Bias exists in both quantitative and qualitative research—it comes in differently, and both approaches take great pains to eliminate it.  This takes us to our next section:  recognizing our own personal biases.

Recognition of Personal Bias

As we will see, researcher bias is a significant issue that recurs throughout the entire research process.  Scholars have observed that methodological choices are determined not only by the nature of the topic or problem being investigated and the resources available, but also by the particular training and socialization processes to which a researcher has been exposed.  This includes all of us, whether we are actually conductors of research or are consumers of research.  Gill and Johnson, in their book Research Methods for Managers \(2002\), offer a diagnostic exercise regarding one’s predispositions toward particular research approaches.

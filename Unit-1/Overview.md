### In the second half of the day we will provide an introduction to the course, familiarizing you with foundational concepts related to scholarly inquiry. In particular, we will focus on our thinking about what scholarship, research, and evidence-based “best practices” leadership look like. We will then look at research generally and focus on the importance of the questions that drive research generally, and begin to articulate individually the research interests that drive you in your professional life.

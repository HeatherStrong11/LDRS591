Inquiry is “the process of developing skills to arrive at understandings of a problem, an issue, or a phenomenon, through the process of asking good questions, searching out good evidence, and arriving at well-reasoned conclusions" \(Penner, 2017\).

In this first unit, we will set the stage for our work in LDRS 591 by first looking at the reason the course LDRS 591 even exists:  to support the MA Leadership program capstone, the Learning Integration Project \(LDRS 697/698\).

In the second half of the day we will provide an introduction to the course, familiarizing you with foundational concepts related to scholarly inquiry. In particular, we will focus on our thinking about what scholarship, research, and evidence-based “best practices” leadership look like. We will then look at research generally and focus on the importance of the questions that drive research generally, and begin to articulate individually the research interests that drive you in your professional life.

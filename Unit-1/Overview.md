In the second section of unit 1 we will provide an introduction to the course, familiarizing you with foundational concepts related to scholarly inquiry. In particular, we will focus on what scholarship, research, and evidence-based “best practices” leadership look like. We will then look at the philosophical foundations of research, examine the connection between leadership and scholarly inquiry,  focus on the importance of the questions that drive research generally, and begin to articulate individually the research interests that drive you in your professional life.

In the second section of unit 1 we will provide an introduction to research, familiarizing you with foundational concepts related to scholarly inquiry. In particular, we will focus on the philosophical foundations of research, examine the connection between leadership and scholarly inquiry, and what evidence-based â€œbest practices" leadership look like. We will then look at the importance of the questions that drive research generally, and begin to articulate individually the research interests that drive you in your professional life.

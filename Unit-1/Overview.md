### What is inquiry?

Inquiry is “the process of developing skills to arrive at understandings of a problem, an issue, or a phenomenon, through the process of asking good questions, searching out good evidence, and arriving at well-reasoned conclusions" \(Penner, 2017\).

In this first unit, we will set the stage for our work in LDRS 591 by first looking at the reason the course LDRS 591 even exists:  to support the MA Leadership program capstone, the Learning Integration Project \(LDRS 697/698\).  The course provides an overview of: the research process, the activity of critical analyses, and associated skills required for scholarship and research.  It is the main prerequisite for the culminating activity of the MA in Leadership program, LDRS 697/698.

LDRS 591 is positioned in the first year of your program to strengthen your analytical and writing skills; it will benefit you in your remaining course work.  The course aims to equip you as a scholar-practitioner.

By now you are well aware of the applied nature of the MA in Leadership program.  This feature may be an important part of what attracted you to the program!  Why then study research methods?  Why worry about scholarly inquiry?  This course in research methods/scholarly inquiry helps you to develop systematic thinking skills applicable in all realms of leadership and everyday life.  As Plano-Clark & Creswell note, research adds to your professional knowledge, informs your position in policy debates, and contributes to the improvement in your practice \(2010, pp. 4-5\).  Moreover, our leadership practice is ideally evidence-based; that is, based on evidence derived from systematic scholarly inquiry.

A cautionary note:  This course is not intended as a research methods course that will develop advanced or even intermediate skills in empirical investigation in quantitative and qualitative methods.  Rather, the course provides an introductory “toolkit” that will support your work on your applied MA in Leadership activities in LDRS 697/698 and in your further professional work.  The course focuses on identifying the skills of academic writing and retrieval and critical appraisal of scholarly literature.  Its aim is to equip you to be a knowledgeable and critical consumer of scholarly literature in general and research in particular.

The course has been developed around several key ideas:  
•    As with other MA in Leadership courses, the onus for learning in this course is on you. What does this mean? Simply stated, the benefit that comes to you will be directly related to your personal level of engagement.  
•    The course builds a community of scholarship.



In the second half of the day we will provide an introduction to the course, familiarizing you with foundational concepts related to scholarly inquiry. In particular, we will focus on our thinking about what scholarship, research, and evidence-based “best practices” leadership look like. We will then look at research generally and focus on the importance of the questions that drive research generally, and begin to articulate individually the research interests that drive you in your professional life.

<h3>Unit 1 Assessment</h3>
In unit 1, you are asked to write the following blog post:
<h4>Part 1</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Create a post (250-500 words), and explain what your experience is with "research". Next, discuss at least one example of a decision you have made as a leader and explain how you made that decision. Make sure to include on what type of information you used to base your decision (e.g., values, research, policy, past experience, expert opinion).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Part 2</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Answer the following questions: (250-500 words)
<ul>
 	<li>What factors do you think shape your decision-making process as a leader?</li>
 	<li>Do you agree or disagree with the proposition made in the course notes (by the authors) that one’s worldview influences the types of questions that you ask, and the processes that you use to find the answers to your questions?</li>
 	<li>Close with one question that invites further comment and discussion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Part 3</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Discuss the following questions (250-500 words):
<ul>
 	<li>How did the authors of the articles conceptualize evidence-based leadership?</li>
 	<li>What is considered as "evidence"?</li>
 	<li>In your own words, why is evidence-based decision-making important?</li>
 	<li>Close with one question that invites further comment and discussion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

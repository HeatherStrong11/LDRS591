This week in Unit 3 you will be discovering how to develop your professional scholarly voice, specifically through your scholarly writing.  This means that you will be reading content that will help you understand that there are different writing styles that are used in the world of academia and how important it is to use APA style in the MA Lead program.

Your learning activities this week are focused on applying the APA standards for general aspects of writing, mechanics of writing and citing sources.  You will also get to apply these skills in assignment 2 which is your scholarly article review, and then continue to practice them in assignment 3 and 5.
<h3>Developing your professional voice</h3>
When you are asked to write a scholarly paper in graduate school, what you are really being asked to do is to develop your professional voice (McDonald, 2011). A professional voice can be described as utilizing formal language, good vocabulary and appropriate tone in your written and oral communication (Walden University Writing Center, 2017). Characteristics of a strong professional voice are writing concisely, with clarity and precision, and appropriately citing your sources (McDonald, 2011).

Developing your professional voice is important because some students will turn their papers into professional manuscripts that will be submitted to a journal or a book. Some students may be asked to present their work at a professional conference. McDonald suggests that "for most students, writing papers in graduate school is an exercise in presenting important information in an easy to understand and concise way" (p.125).

A well developed professional voice can also benefit you in your professional context. For example, at work you may be asked to write a briefing document for your school or hospital board, or you may be asked to share your ideas with other professionals at a conference, or you may be asked to write a grant to fund your organizations new project. These are just three examples of professional situations where it is important to have a well-developed professional voice so that you can communicate in a clear and concise way.

In order to communicate well, you need to have a system to organize your thoughts so that the information you are writing is presented in an organized and clear manner. There are a wide variety of publication styles that are employed today in universities and in scholarly publications. A few that you may be familiar with are Chicago style, MLA style, Turbian style and APA style. The American Psychological Association (APA) has developed a writing style that is used to establish a standard of written communication. This standard includes: the organization of content, writing style or writing mechanics, citing references, and how to prepare a manuscript for publication in certain disciplines (APA, 2010). The MA Leadership program uses the APA Manual (6th edition) as the model for formatting written work formally submitted.

Aside from simplifying the work of your instructors by having everyone use the same format for a given paper, using APA style makes it easier for readers to understand a text by providing a familiar structure they can follow. Abiding by APA's standards as a writer will allow you to:

1) Provide readers with cues they can use to follow your ideas more efficiently.

2) Provide readers with dates of publications to help them locate current information that may be of interest to them.

3) Allow readers to focus more on your ideas by not distracting them with unfamiliar formatting.

4) Establish your credibility in the field by demonstrating an awareness of your audience and their needs as fellow researchers.

<h3>Learning Activity 3.1 - Read, Watch and Reflect</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Read chapter 1 of the APA manual and also the Appendix of the Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) text.</li>
 	<li>Next, watch the following video tutorial  "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZEXIve3hu0">Writing in Psychology</a>" by Dr. Mark Hatala.  In the video Dr. Hatala explains the importance of learning APA style for writing in the behavioural and social sciences.</li>
 	<li>In your reflective learning journal, discuss your experience writing with APA style and why you think scholarly writing is important for you as a leader.</li>
 	<li>Note that these questions make up Part 1 of your Blog assignment for this unit.  See Unit 3 Assessment for more details.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is scholarly writing?</h3>
According to Heady (2013), graduate-level (or scholarly) writing is "clear, correct and concise, but it adds the elements of originality and discipline specific expertise" (p. 2). Heady suggests that graduate-level writing explores a topic or a research question in an original way, demonstrates extensive research done on the topic, has a strong organizational structure, and is written for a professional audience. The scholarly writer writes in a way that is skillful, engaging and organized well so that the paper moves from point to point allowing the reader to follow in a logical progression. Heady also states that "a good paper has a clear and obvious structure: you can enter it through a clear, well-composed introduction, you move from section to section, and you exit where you know you have been and what you have seen" (p. 73).
<h5>Structure and Organization</h5>
Writing a scholarly paper often follows a very distinct organizational structure and includes: a title page, an introduction, methods and results, a discussion and a list of references. Within each section of a scholarly paper, each paragraph utilizes a combination three types of content: claims, evidence and transitions. Heady states that "claims are the points you want to prove, interpretations you want to offer, and assertions you want to make, whereas, evidence is the material you use to back up your claims" (pp. 74-75). Some examples of types of evidence that may be used to support claims include: "quotes from a book, citations from an article, data from a study, personal experience, historical facts, statistics, etc. Transitions are one or two words that help you move from one claim to another" (pp. 74-75).

An example of the three types of content (claims, evidence and transitions) included in a paragraph of scholarly writing is provided below from the article "A Systematic Literature Review of Servant Leadership Theory in Organizational Contexts" by Parris and Peachy (2013, pp. 377-378):
<blockquote>Over the years, some leadership scholars have called attention to the implicit connection between ethics and leadership. A burgeoning new research area and leadership theory that has been linked to ethics, virtues and morality is servant leadership (Graham 1991; Lancot and Irving 2010; Parolini et al. 2009; Russell 2001; Whetstone, 2002). Despite servant leadership being coined by Robert K. Greenleaf over three decades ago in 1970, it remains understudied yet prominently practiced in boardrooms and organizations (Bass and Bass 2008; Spears 2005).</blockquote>
From the example above, you can see that a topic is introduced in the first sentence. A claim with supporting evidence is provided in the second sentence (with references) and the transition begins in the third sentence with the word "despite". The third sentence also includes a claim and supporting evidence. This paragraph structure is typical of what you would find in scholarly writing. Scholarly writing involves putting your own thoughts and ideas (claims) in context by ensuring that you are citing the ideas of those who have influenced you (APA, 2010, p.169).

Heady (2013) suggests five general rules you should always follow when you are organizing your paper (p. 80):
<ol>
 	<li>You must provide enough background information to give your reader a good working knowledge of your topic.</li>
 	<li>Your background information must lead logically to your research question.</li>
 	<li>All claims/ideas/facts must be backed up by evidence.</li>
 	<li>All evidence must be related to a claim/idea/fact.</li>
 	<li>If evidence does not back up a claim, you need to explain why and/or account for it.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Unit 8 Assessment</h2>
<h3>Unit 8 Blog</h3>
Blog posts are to be submitted by<strong> Friday at midnight</strong> of the week they are assigned to allow time for your colleagues to respond to your questions over the weekend. Be sure to respond to 2 or 3 of your colleagues posts.

In unit 8, you are asked to write the following blog post:

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000">[Heather, please delete questions that aren't graded.  Also, please check the word count.  We can say 500-750 total words, or split it up for the different parts]</span></strong>
<h4>Part B</h4>
Think about some practical problems that you have faced in your professional life that you would like to change. In your blog, list three problems that matter to you and that you think you can systematically address in your work situation. After reflecting on these problems, select one that you would like to address for your action research project.
<h3></h3>
<h4>Part B</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Using one of the practical problems you identified from Part A, create an idea for an action research project following the steps described by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) on pp. 440-442.</li>
 	<li>Record that idea in a podcast so that it can be presented to your colleagues for feedback.</li>
 	<li>Your introduction should include your key problem and explain the structure of your presentation.</li>
 	<li>Your project idea should relate to a practical leadership issue you are currently facing.</li>
 	<li>Your project idea should be clear and well organized.</li>
 	<li>Your project should fit within 3-5 minutes but no more than 6 minutes.</li>
 	<li>Provide a conclusion that gives a call to action.</li>
 	<li>Upload your podcast to <a href="https://soundcloud.com">soundcloud.com</a>, <a href="https://tapewrite.com">tapewrite.com</a>, or another suitable online service and embed it in a new post on your blog.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Reminder: </strong>Make sure you take some time to practice what you are going to say (I highly recommend creating a script) and give yourself lots of time to record, make mistakes, re-record, make more mistakes, take a break, re-record and then post it on your blog.

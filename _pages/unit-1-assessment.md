<h2>Unit 1 Assessment</h2>
<h3>Unit 1 Blog</h3>
<strong>Expectations for</strong> <strong>Blog posts</strong>

As you work through the material in this course, you will be asked to create blog posts.  Some of the blog posts do not require a discussion or a response, however, some of the blog posts do require you to close with one question that invites further comments and discussion from your colleagues.  Please do your best to complete the blog posts that require a response by<strong> Friday at midnight</strong> of the week they are assigned to allow time for your colleagues to respond to your questions over the weekend.

<strong>Replying to Colleagues’ Posts</strong>
<p class="Paragraph">You do not have to reply to all of your colleagues blog posts when a discussion question is posted. However, you should make an effort to read through your colleagues posts and respond substantively to at least two other classmates' blogs. Your replies should offer new substantiated ideas or thoughtful questions.</p>
<em>Substantive responses may include:</em>
<ul>
 	<li>Providing a new thought, idea, or perspective;</li>
 	<li>Citing an experience or example of what we are learning;</li>
 	<li>Adding a new twist on a perspective;</li>
 	<li>Critically thinking about an idea/concept;</li>
 	<li>Questioning or challenging a principle/perspective;</li>
 	<li>Asking a question or making a comment that shows you are interested in what another person says or encourages another person to elaborate on something they have already said;</li>
 	<li>Sharing a resource (a reading, web link, video) not covered in the syllabus that adds new information or perspectives to our learning;</li>
 	<li>Making a comment that underscores the link between two people’s contributions and making this link explicit in your comment. Or making a summary observation that takes into account several people’s contributions and that touches on a recurring theme in the discussion.</li>
</ul>
What Substantive Participation is <strong>NOT:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Very basic comments such as “I agree” or “I disagree;”</li>
 	<li>Restating what has been said <em>(unless there is a direct purpose in doing so);</em></li>
 	<li>Disrespectfully disagreeing;</li>
 	<li>Pat answers that are not thought-provoking or do not move the dialogue forward;</li>
 	<li>Greetings/conversation better suited for the Virtual Collegium.</li>
</ul>
Below are examples of how to stimulate your own and others’ thinking:
<ul>
 	<li>What would happen if…</li>
 	<li>Other times it may be helpful to…</li>
 	<li>It is my understanding…what is your experience with this?</li>
 	<li>You might approach this from…</li>
 	<li>Is it possible that…</li>
 	<li>Would you consider…</li>
 	<li>Maybe…</li>
 	<li>Possibly…</li>
 	<li>Sometimes…</li>
 	<li>I’m wondering if…</li>
 	<li>Do you think…</li>
</ul>
<p class="Paragraph"><strong>   </strong></p>
In unit 1, you are asked to write the following blog post (500 words total):

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000">[Heather, please delete questions that aren't graded.  Also, please check the word count.  We can say 500-750 total words, or split it up for the different parts]</span></strong>
<h4>Part 1</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Begin your post by introducing yourself and explain what your experience is with "research".</li>
 	<li>Next, discuss the differences between informal research (everyday problem solving) and scholarly inquiry (formal research).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Part 2</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Describe at least one example of a decision you have made as a leader.</li>
 	<li>Consider the factors that shape your decision making process as a leader.</li>
 	<li>Discuss how scholarly inquiry applies to everyday decision making.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Part 3</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Discuss, in your own words, why is evidence-based decision-making important?</li>
 	<li>Close your blog post with one question that invites further comment and discussion from your colleagues.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

If you are uncertain about how to set-up your blog, go to the following link<span style="color: #ff0000"><strong> [Kelly to insert link]</strong></span>.

Also, be sure to add the categories for this post: <strong>LDRS591</strong> and <strong>Unit 1</strong>. This helps to organized the class blogs and interactions.

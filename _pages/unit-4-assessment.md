<h4>Part A</h4>
In reference to the article by Sendjaya and Sarros (2002), create a post (250-300 words), reflecting on the following questions:
<ul>

 	<li>Why would this article interest researchers in the leadership field?</li>
 	<li>What is already known about servant leadership?</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h4>Part B</h4>
Choose <strong>one</strong> of the servant leadership articles listed under the Unit 4 resources to focus on to answer the questions below (250-500 words).

Using the evaluation criteria on p. 93, answer the following questions to evaluate the statement of the problem in the servant leadership article you chose to focus on. The figure on page 94 provides a template for recording your rating and rationale.

 	<li>Is the topic interesting?</li>
 	<li>Is there a meaningful problem?</li>
 	<li>Is the importance of the problem justified?</li>
 	<li>Are there deficiencies in the knowledge about the problem?</li>
 	<li>Is an audience identified and are there specific examples of how the audience can use the missing knowledge?</li>
 	<li>Does the passage clearly argue that the study is warranted?</li>
 	<li>Is the passage well written?</li>
</ul>
Make sure that you include your article reference, quality rating (0-3) and also the rationale/evidence for your rating in your response.
<h4>Part C</h4>
Using the servant leadership article from Part 2 and the evaluation criteria on p. 143 in Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015), complete the following questions to evaluate the literature review in the article you chose to focus on.

 	<li>Is the literature review documented properly?</li>
 	<li>Is the literature thoughtfully synthesized?</li>
 	<li>Is the literature critically examined?</li>
 	<li>Does the study have a strong foundation in the literature?</li>

 	<li>Is the overall intent of the study appropriate?</li>
 	<li>Are the participants and the sites appropriate?</li>
 	<li>Is the purpose of the study narrowed through appropriate research questions and/or hypotheses?</li>
 	<li>Does the purpose of the study follow logically from the statement of the problem and the literature review?</li>
 	<li>Is the purpose consistent with the study's overall approach?</li>
</ul>
Make sure that you include your article reference, quality rating (0-3) and also the rationale/evidence for your rating in your response.  (250-500 words).

<h3>Unit 2 Assessment</h3>
<h3>Unit 2 Blog</h3>
In unit 1, you are asked to write the following blog post:

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000">[Heather, please delete questions that aren't graded.  Also, please check the word count. ]</span></strong>
<h4>Part A</h4>
Create a new blog post, and write the author, date and title (including the hyperlink) of a journal article you found in your search in the Academic Search Complete database. Post this information on your blog. Next, briefly assess the source in the following categories.
<ul>
 	<li>Authority – Who is the author? What are the author’s credentials?</li>
 	<li>Currency – Is the source up to date?</li>
 	<li>Purpose – What are the intentions of the author? Who is the intended audience?</li>
 	<li>Publication type/process – Who published the article? Was the article peer reviewed?</li>
 	<li>Are there any obvious biases and/or special interests that the author acknowledges?</li>
</ul>
This post should be between 250-500 words.
<h4>Part B</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Post the author, date and title (including the hyperlink) of the e-book you found in Activity 2.3 on your blog. Next, briefly assess the source in the following categories.
<ul>
 	<li>Authority – Who is the author? What are the author’s credentials?</li>
 	<li>Currency – Is the source up to date?</li>
 	<li>Purpose – What are the intentions of the author? Who is the intended audience?</li>
 	<li>Publication type/process – Who published the article? Was the article peer reviewed?</li>
 	<li>Are there any obvious biases and/or special interests that the author acknowledges?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Part C</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Describe what sources of information you will use the most to conduct research on your topic. How will you evaluate these sources to make sure they are credible and reliable sources of information?</li>
</ul>
If you are uncertain about how to set-up your blog, go to the following link<span style="color: #ff0000"><strong> [Kelly to insert link]</strong></span>.

Also, be sure to add the categories for this post: <strong>LDRS591</strong> and <strong>Unit 2</strong>. This helps to organized the class blogs and interactions.

<h3>Assignment 1: Clarifying your Research Interest</h3>
The Master of Arts in Leadership program values the application of best practices to your personal and professional practice. Before we get into some of the concrete realities of accessing scholarly literature, we would like you to take time to reflect on and articulate some of the salient interests in your personal and professional life and practice.

In this assignment, you develop a concept map depicting your interests (personal and/or professional) and use the concept map to generate research questions amenable to scholarly inquiry. A concept map is a general method used by individuals or groups to describe ideas in the form of a picture (Trochim, 2001). The picture can then be used to articulate or refine research areas relevant to scientists and stakeholders.
<h5>Steps to complete this assignment</h5>
<ul>
 	<li>Read Trochim's (2001) guidelines for concept mapping at <a href="http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/conmap.htm">http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/conmap.php</a>.</li>
 	<li>Use <a href="https://www.draw.io/">draw.io</a> (FREE!), <a href="https://www.gliffy.com/">Gliffy.com</a> (paid), or another mapping program, to create a map similar to the sample pictured below, with you at the centre and your personal and professional interests around the outside.
<ul>
 	<li>The letters A through D represent areas of interest to the researcher (labelled “ME” in the sample below). For example, A might be "Health," B might be "Exercise," and so on, with as many different circles as you, the researcher ("ME") has an interest in exploring.</li>
 	<li>It is possible to add other circles to the concept map for more differentiation. Please feel free to include related interests as sub-items from other interests. You might have item C as "Teaching" and C1 as "K12" and C2 as "Higher Ed."</li>
 	<li>Using the areas of interest identified in the concept map, most researchers then "link" areas together in the form of research questions. For example, if circle A was "Exercise" and circle B was "Health," then possible research questions might include:
<ul>
 	<li>Does exercise participation improve or diminish health?</li>
 	<li>Does health limit exercise participation?</li>
</ul>
There is no limit to the number (and nature) of research questions the researcher creates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Use the mapping program to draw connections between areas of interest. Use a different style of connector, such as a dotted line, for these links.</li>
 	<li>Download your map as a .jpg or .png and upload it to your blog.</li>
 	<li>Create a new blog post with your concept map as the featured image and answer the following questions:
<ul>
 	<li>What research questions can be generated from combining different areas of personal and/or professional interests you have identified in the concept map? Please state three potential research questions that could be studied.</li>
 	<li>Identify the research question you feel is <strong>the strongest one</strong> to pursue for a future research paper, and outline reasons for your selection.</li>
 	<li>In what broad fields do you anticipate searching for literature that might inform your research question (e.g., education, business, psychology, healthcare, leadership, religion)?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
The written portion of your assignment should be 500 words or less.

Also, be sure to add the categories for this post: <strong>LDRS591</strong> and <strong>Assignment 1</strong>.

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Personal and/or professional interests are described. <strong>(4 points)</strong></li>

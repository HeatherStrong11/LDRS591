### Learning Activity 8.2 - Podcast

This learning activity asks you to create an idea for an action research project based on one of the practical problems you have identified from your professional life. You will present this project idea in a podcast for your colleagues. There is a section of the Orientation that explains how to create a podcast. If you know how to create video you are welcome to do that instead. It is your choice whether to create a podcast or video. This learning activity is intended to be informal, so do not spend too much time planning and researching your topic.

##### Instructions: {#criteria-and-evaluation}

* Using one of the practical problems you identified from learning activity 8.1, create an idea for an action research project following the 8 steps described by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) on pp. 440-442.
* Record that idea in a podcast so that it can be presented to your colleagues for feedback.
* Your introduction should include your key problem and explain the structure of your presentation.
* Your project idea should relate to a practical leadership issue you are currently facing.
* Your project idea should be clear and well organized.
* Your project should fit within 3-5 minutes but no more than 6 minutes.
* Provide a conclusion that gives a call to action.
* Upload your podcast to [soundcloud.com](https://soundcloud.com), [tapewrite.com](https://tapewrite.com), or another suitable online service and embed it in a new post on your blog.

### Learning Activity 8.3

This learning activity asks you to peer review one project by colleagues in the class. The instructor will inform you of the project that you will be peer reviewing.

Make notes about the strengths of the project idea as well as areas to work on (clarify, more analysis, more personal application) by using the evaluation criteria for an action research study outlined by Plano-Clark and Creswell on page 444-445. Here are questions you should address in your evaluation:

* Does the project focus on a real problem in practice?
* Does the researcher plan to study his or her own practices or plan to collaborate with community members?
* Does the project include careful reflection about the problem?
* Does the researcher plan to gather several sources of information (e.g., qualitative and quantitative procedures)?
* Does the researcher develop a clear plan for addressing the problem?
* Does the project include reflecting, thinking, looking, and gathering information and acting?
* Will the results of the project enhance the lives of those involved?

Summarize your notes in a response to your colleagues projects in 250-350 words.

Please post your review ***on your own blog*** and include a link to their post. Remember that your response will be visible to all members of the class.
<h3>Learning Activity 8.4</h3>

<h2>Unit 2 Learning Activities</h2>
<span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>[Heather, I've added this welcome below.  We can either keep it here, integrate it with the Unit 2 Overview, or you might want to keep it as an Instructor's note that you post each week.  Please let me know your preference/]</strong></span>

Welcome to Week 2! This week you will be exploring the topic "Accessing and Evaluating Scholarly Literature".  This unit will help you gain familiarity with various genres of scholarly literature and help you get a sense of what scholarly sources of information are available, given your own research interests.  In this unit you will also gain first-hand experience in locating and organizing and evaluating relevant scholarly literature.

The learning activities in this unit will walk you through some very practical readings and video tutorials on how to access scholarly literature.  There are also three blog posts this week and those are focused on evaluating sources.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000">[I've added in your notes. Please check whether the flow is correct - as the content relates to the learning activities that follow]</span></strong>
<h3>The Research Process</h3>
Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) define research as "a process of steps used to collect and analyze information in order to increase our knowledge about a topic or issue" (p. 4). Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) identify eight steps in the research process which provide us with a useful framework that describes what researchers do when they conduct their studies. These steps help us understand the information that is included in their reports. Listed below are each of the eight steps in the research process.
<ol>
 	<li>The whole process begins with <strong>identifying the research problem</strong>. This step is vitally important. The statement of the research problem is the very foundation that subsequent research is built upon, and quite literally guides each and every step moving forward.</li>
 	<li>A <strong>literature review</strong> is a summary of the “state of knowledge” in a given area.This step is the primary focus of this course and involves locating relevant scholarly literature, and analyzing, synthesizing and summarizing what precedent literature has to say about a specific topic.</li>
 	<li>The <strong>purpose of research</strong> includes identifying the objective of a study (e.g., purpose statement). This information is typically expressed in a few research questions or hypotheses.</li>
 	<li>Next, it is important to <strong>choose a research design.</strong> This step involves describing an overall plan or approach of the study and also explains the methods used to carry out the plan.</li>
 	<li><strong>Selecting participants and collecting data</strong> includes who will be the participants, how you will collect information from those participants, and what permission you need to obtain in order to collect the information.</li>
 	<li><strong>Analyzing data</strong> involves systematic processes to make sense of the information that has been gathered. We call this process “results,” which are then reported in forms appropriate to the research method (e.g., statistics or words).</li>
 	<li><strong>Drawing conclusions</strong> means interpreting the results and explaining how the conclusions relate to the research questions/hypotheses, and/or similar studies. There is also a discussion of limitations of the study and often suggestions of implications for the intended audiences, for practice and for future research.</li>
 	<li><strong>Disseminating and evaluating the research.</strong> Usually the term “disseminated” means “published.” The most common way that research is disseminated is in journals dedicated to publishing primary research.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Significant Questions</h3>
The most significant part of the research process is asking a good research question.  This is something that will be highly relevant to successful completion of most of your assignments in this course, particularly the very first assignment.  Your research question will be the guide that you use to complete assignments 1, 2, 3, and 5.

The research process often starts when you ask a question about something that you observe: How, What, When, Who, Which, Why, or Where?  Questions can be based on what you observe in the real world, or on intuition or a “gut feeling”.

Let me begin by telling you a little about my own research journey and then I will give you some practical tips to help you on your way.  In my undergraduate degree I studied two majors: psychology (the study of the mind) and kinesiology (the study of body movement).  In the final year of my undergrad I took the most fascinating course called the Psychology of Health and Well-being.  I was very interested in the topics that we studied in this course because it was the perfect pairing of my two chosen majors - the mind and the body.  One particular topic captured my attention and I was unable to let go of my interest in it.  The topic was female athletes and eating disorders.  This topic interested me for many reasons, but I was particularly interested in the impact that disordered eating (both physically and psychologically) had on the performance of females athletes.  At the end of my four year degree, I decided my education needed to continue into graduate work so that I could continue exploring my interest in this topic.

As I entered my Master's my focus was still on the topic of understanding eating disorders, but the population that I was interested in - female athletes with eating disorders - was a difficult and challenging group to study.  So I needed to make some adaptations to the research that I wanted to pursue in order to make my thesis project more manageable.  I will save you all the details of the 2-year journey of learning what works and what doesn't when you are studying a clinical population, but what I ended up with was a very different thesis project then what I had originally intended.

The topic I ended up studying was the differences between women with eating disorders, at-risk for eating disorders, and those not at-risk on a very specific psychological construct which is called self-presentation motivation.  Self-presentation motivation reflects the process that we go through in an attempt to monitor and control the impression we make on others (Schlenker &amp; Leary, 1982).  For example, when we go for a job interview we usually wear nice clothes, get a hair cut, rehearse interview questions because we want to make a good impression on a potential employer.  Now self-presentation motivation in itself is not a single construct that can be empirically measured.  In my study this concept was measured using several different questionnaires and they were a) fear of negative evaluation (when a person is fearful of receiving disapproval and criticism from others; Leary, 1983), b) public self-consciousness (the awareness or sensitivity a person experiences from the opinions of others; Fenigstein, Scheier, &amp; Buss, 1975), c) social physique anxiety (the anxiety experienced when your body is being evaluated by others; Hart, Rejeski, &amp; Leary, 1989), and d) self-presentational efficacy (the probability of conveying a desired impression on others; Leary &amp; Atherton, 1986).  If you are interested in reading more about this study you can find the published article here <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471015306000122">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471015306000122</a>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">This is what my research question started as: <em><strong>How do eating disorders impact the performance of female athletes?</strong></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">What my research question ended up as: <em><strong>What are the differences in self-presentation motivation across three groups which have known differences on measures of eating disordered behaviour?</strong></em></p>
Sometimes the topic we start out with is not the one we end up studying.  This was certainly true in my case.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000">[Heather, are there any formative, non-graded questions or activities for this section?  1-2 questions for their learning journal?]</span></strong>

&nbsp;
<h3>Accessing Scholarly Literature</h3>
Accessing scholarly literature can be a frustrating process. The key is to start at the beginning with a good plan and keep yourself organized. Organizing tools are important both to streamline your literature search and to summarize and synthesize. As you begin your literature search (library books, online periodicals, internet search), organize your search into general topic areas and more specific keywords. It is very helpful to have some sense of the various fields that will potentially inform your research interests.

Part of your planning and organizing is to recognize various genres of scholarly literature and to be aware of the limitations inherent to each. A very helpful discussion is provided by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) on pages 10-12.

There are three different categories of documents where you can find research reports: summaries and books, journal articles and early stage materials. Many times you will see this sequence followed: A research project is completed, and the research is first published in a Mater's thesis or PhD dissertation, or as a paper in a symposium or conference. The research report then goes to a professional journal for publication and eventually it is incorporated into a book. By the time a dissertation is successfully defended, the actual research may have been conducted two to three years earlier. It could easily take another three years for a journal article to make it through the peer-review process and be published. Therefore, the research referenced in the journal article could be at least five years old. It could easily take another five years for high quality publishers to work through their review processes and publish something in a book. Obviously, what you lose in this process is cutting edge thought.

The chart below summarizes the relative advantages and disadvantages of each genre of scholarly literature. You can refer to Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) pages 10-12 for more details.

[table id=5 /]
<h5>*Note</h5>
High quality journals are determined by the peer review process, the journals impact factor (IF) and by professional reputation. The impact factor is a measure of the frequency with which the average article in a journal has been cited in a particular year. The IF is used to measure the importance or rank of a journal by calculating the times its articles are cited. The IF can be found on the home page of most online journals.

Peer review is the process used by publishers and editors of academic/scholarly journals to ensure that the articles they publish meet the accepted standards of their discipline. Manuscripts being considered for publication are sent to independent experts in the same field (the author's scholarly or scientific peers). They evaluate the quality of the scholarship, reliability of findings, relevance to the field, appropriateness for the journal, etc.

Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) provide a very useful tip regarding what sources of literature you should access. They suggest that although you are probably used to searching for books on a particular topic, it is important to "focus on reading recent research studies published as journal articles to learn the most up-to-date information in your profession" (p. 11). As a general rule, articles published within the past 10 years should give you a good idea of what is current in your profession.

&nbsp;
<h3>Learning Activity 2.2: Read, Watch, and Search!</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Read chapters 4 and 6 in the Badke (2017) text.</li>
 	<li>Watch the tutorial "<a href="https://vimeo.com/161998287/7661f12293">Preparing a research question for a database search</a>".</li>
 	<li>Next, return to the link <a href="http://libguides.twu.ca/library_research/home">http://libguides.twu.ca/library_research/home</a> and click <a href="http://libguides.twu.ca/library_research/articles">"How to search for articles.</a>" Begin by selecting one of video tutorials in the section multi-disciplinary databases such as <a href="https://vimeo.com/160918763/913f61489b">"Academic Search Complete."</a> Watch the video tutorial to get an idea of how to search for a topic in a multi-disciplinary database.</li>
 	<li>Keeping in mind the topic and specific question(s) you identified in Assignment 1, use the Academic Search Complete database at the TWU library to locate a good example of a <strong>journal article</strong>. To do this you will need to:</li>
 	<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.twu.ca/library">library home page</a>.
<ul>
 	<li>In the first search window, click the databases tab and then click the articles and databases link which brings you to a different screen.</li>
 	<li>In the Database Guide screen you will need to select "A-B" from the A-Z list of databases at the bottom of this page.</li>
 	<li>The first database that appears on the next screen is "Academic Search Complete." Select this database.</li>
 	<li>You will be asked to sign in as a student with your pass ID and password to access the online database.</li>
 	<li>Once you have signed in, then you will be able to type your topic or question in the search window of "Academic Search Complete."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Utilizing Scholarly Literature</h3>
After you have determined what sources you will be accessing, you need to conduct a search, and then keep track of your literature search strategy and results. The simplest way to do this is to use an online reference manager that will help you collect, organize, cite and share your references according to the referencing style you will be using.  There are several free, online reference managers available such as <a href="https://www.refworks.com/refworks2/help/Welcome.htm">Refworks</a>, <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>, and <a href="http://endnote.com/">EndNote</a>. TWU library has a research guide that describes <a href="http://libguides.twu.ca/EndNote/">how to use EndNote</a>. This library guide will help you sign up for an EndNote account and also help you figure out how to use EndNote to download and store your citations in folders and then input citations into Word documents and create reference lists.

After you have retrieved the results from your database searches and organized them in folders in your reference manager, you need to select documents to review. Begin by reviewing the titles and abstracts. For those articles that you deem worthwhile, skim the article itself to determine if it is relevant to your topic. Read the introduction and literature review and examine the reference list.

As you collect relevant literature you can either enter it into a summary chart or just collect the abstracts. There is no single correct way to do this—but you will need to develop some sort of system that works for you. An example of a summary chart is provided below:

[table id=7 /]

The research process is not always linear. You may have a great research question or research topic in mind, but as you begin your initial database and library searches you may find yourself changing or refining your topic. Sometimes you will not find any information on the topic you have chosen because the topic is so new and no one has done any research on the topic yet. Sometimes you will not find any information on the topic you have chosen because you are not using the right search terms or keywords.

If you are having difficulty finding research articles and books on your topic then try to reexamine the keywords you are using for your search. Look up synonyms for your keywords and try to find the terms that are used in the research literature. Another helpful tip is to look at the reference list of any articles or books that seem closest to your topic. This can help you to see what sources other authors have used and can be a helpful strategy to track down articles and books on your topic.

&nbsp;
<h3>Learning Activity 2.3: Searching for Books</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Go to <a href="http://libguides.twu.ca/library_research/home">http://libguides.twu.ca/library_research/home</a> and click "<a href="http://libguides.twu.ca/library_research/books">How to search for books</a>". Begin by selecting one of video tutorials in the section "searching for e-books" such as "<a href="https://vimeo.com/164163119/b24ecb42e6">searching for e-books in the classic catalogue</a>." Watch this video tutorial to get an idea of how to search for a topic found in an e-book.</li>
 	<li>Keeping in mind the topic and specific question(s) you identified in Assignment 1, use the library catalogue to locate a good example of an <strong>e-book.</strong></li>
</ul>
Note that you will be asked some questions related to your search as part of your Blog assignment for this unit.  See Unit 2 Assessment for more details.

&nbsp;
<h3>Evaluating Scholarly Sources</h3>
After you have found several articles and books related to your research topic and skimmed them for relevance, the next step is to evaluate your information sources. Unfortunately, not all information that you will come across is going to be valid. Just because you find articles and books at the library does not mean that the information will be accurate or of high quality.

As an MA Leadership student, and as a professional, it is imperative that you are able to critically evaluate information in order to conduct quality research yourself, inform policies and improve your professional practice. To evaluate a source for quality and credibility you need to consider the following:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Authority:</strong> Who is the author? What are the author's credentials (educational background, past writing experience, expertise on the topic)? Is the author's name cited in other sources or reference lists? A simple google search will help you explore these questions.</li>
 	<li><strong>Currency:</strong> When was the source published? Is the source current or out of date for your topic? Remember the general rule is to use sources that have been published within the past 10 years.</li>
 	<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> What is the author’s intention? Is the information the author's opinion or is the author communicating evidence-based results? Who is the author's intended audience? Is it the academic community or consumers? Is the author's point of view objective and impartial? Is the language in the article or book free of emotion or bias?</li>
 	<li><strong>Content:</strong> What kind of information is provided in the article or book? Is it a research article, popular book or opinion piece on a blog? Is the information provided backed up with references or sources? What is the length of the reference list?</li>
 	<li><strong>Publication type/process:</strong> Who published the source? Was the source peer-reviewed? Is the publisher a university press or a large reputable publisher? Is it from a government agency? Is the source self-published?</li>
 	<li><strong>Bias and special interests:</strong> According to Panucci and Williams (2010) bias can occur during all phases of research from design, implementation, and analysis to publication. Therefore, careful attention to the interpretation of research results and study design will help identify bias. Driscoll and Brizee (2017) suggest that when it comes to publishing research reports, "most major publishers are out to make a profit and will either not cater to special interest groups or will clearly indicate when they are catering to special interest groups".</li>
</ul>
<h3>Synthesize and Critique Scholarly Literature.</h3>
A literature review is a summary of the “state of knowledge” in a given area. It involves finding key relevant articles and books, and synthesizing concepts and findings for critical (i.e., careful and judicious) application to a given problem. In other words, a good review of literature is a synthesis of what current scholarly literature has to say regarding a given problem, presented in a coherent and compelling manner. An integral step in this course is to effectively critique and summarize scholarly literature.

An effective summary of an article or book will:
<ul>
 	<li>Mention the problem being addressed.</li>
 	<li>State the central purpose or focus of the study.</li>
 	<li>Briefly state information about the sample, population or participants.</li>
 	<li>Review key results/conclusions that relate to your problem or topic.</li>
</ul>
Once you have highlighted those key points, then you need to critically evaluate the article or book.

An effective critique of an article or a book will:
<ul>
 	<li>Evaluate each section of the article/book – Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion – highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each section.</li>
</ul>
When you are critically evaluating research studies, you are not just listing and summarizing them. You need to assess them, compare and contrast them, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each study or book that you have reviewed. More information on how to specifically evaluate each section of a journal article is coming up in units 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.
<h3>How Much Information Is Enough?</h3>
When doing a review of literature, it may be difficult to determine how much literature to review. To help in this decision, consider the main question of interest, or main subtopics, and include literature on these topics. Begin by reviewing the scholarly literature pertaining to each identified topic. Next, provide a summary of the literature that highlights the most important studies or articles, captures major themes in what you have reviewed and articulates how your research interest intersects with this literature (e.g., why we need to know more, or why the literature needs to be applied in a particular context). In essence, you want to include a summary statement of the state of knowledge in the area you are examining. Keep going until you sense that you have represented fairly the current field of literature. A good indication that you have done that is when you find authors mostly re-stating but not really advancing knowledge in the field. In other words, you have hit saturation.

&nbsp;
<h3>Learning Activity 2.5 - Read, Watch, and Search</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Read chapter 7 in the Badke (2017) text.</li>
 	<li>Go to the link <a href="http://libguides.twu.ca/library_research/home">http://libguides.twu.ca/library_research/home</a> and click "<a href="http://libguides.twu.ca/library_research/skills">How to develop research skills</a>." Begin by watching all of the video tutorials under the section "upgrading your research skills." There are several short videos in this section on Boolean searches, search history, and other search techniques.</li>
 	<li>Next, watch the two videos in the section "using the web." There are two short videos on <a href="https://vimeo.com/160915822/0661b2b1c2">using google scholar</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/162602381/1b0d684fb6">assessing online resources</a> in this section.</li>
 	<li>Consider what sources of information you will use the most to conduct research on your topic. How will you evaluate these sources to make sure they are credible and reliable sources of information?</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Narrowing your Research Topic</h3>
As you've worked your way through some of the learning activities this week, you may have realized that your topic is too broad or too specific and you are not getting the results you are looking for.  In this last section, I want to help you figure out how you can narrow down your research topic into something that will be manageable to write about.

In light of the challenges that you may face as you try to narrow down your research topic into a manageable research question and even further into search terms, I have found a really helpful tool to help you identify your research question.   This tool was originally published in Booth, Colomb, &amp; Williams (2008) and was adapted by <em>The Step-by-Step Guide &amp; Research Rescue: Finding and Narrowing Your Topic</em> (2017). Retrieved from <a href="http://guides.lib.byu.edu/c.php?g=216340&amp;p=1428396">http://guides.lib.byu.edu/c.php?g=216340&amp;p=1428396</a>

If you can fill out this table, you most likely have a narrow enough topic with enough direction to perform some great research.
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>1)  I am researching </strong>______________________________________ (<strong>topic</strong>)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>2)  because I want to find out </strong>______________________________(<strong>issue/question</strong>)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>3)  in order to </strong>________________________________ (<strong>application </strong>- So What? - Project/Audience/Purpose driven)</p>
Here is my research example using the three step process:
<p style="padding-left: 30px">I am researching <b>self-presentation motivation and eating disorders in women</b> (topic)
because I want to find out <strong>if there is a difference in self-presentation motives among women with an eating disorder, at-risk for an eating disorder, and not at-risk for an eating disorder</strong> (issue/question)
in order to <strong>enhance our understanding of the eating disordered population as well as provide insight into the self-presentational motives across known groups.  </strong>(application - <em>audience</em>).</p>
If you need further help with your research question do not hesitate to contact me.  I am here to help!
<h3>Additional sources for finding scholarly literature:</h3>
I also wanted to mention two other sources of information that you can use to gather information on your research topic.  The first suggestion is viewing the TED talk videos.  These videos are a great resource to help you become familiar with a researcher and their work on a specific topic.  You can search almost any topic on the TED website, the videos are usually under 20 minutes, and are very good.  You can find TED site here: <a href="https://www.ted.com/">https://www.ted.com</a>

The second resource is using the reference lists at the back of a book or of a journal article on your topic.  These are both great places to find additional sources of information on your topic and also help you become familiar with who is publishing information in your area of interest.

### Accessing and Evaluating Scholarly Literature

### Overview

In unit 2, we will begin by developing a road map for understanding the research process in general. Then we will spend time focusing on the research questions that drive the research process. You will begin articulating the research interests that you have come across in your professional life. Next, we will focus on gaining familiarity with various genres of scholarly literature, getting a sense of how these genres contribute to your own scholarly endeavours. Through first-hand experience you will begin locating, organizing and evaluating relevant scholarly literature. Two of the major assignments in this course hinge on your ability to conduct a review of precedent literature. Although these assignments are not due until the later in this course, our work in unit 2 is the foundation for those assignments.

### Learning Objectives

1. Identify a research interest and develop a good research question.
2. Identify genres of scholarly writing.
3. Appraise the utility of various genres of scholarly writing.
4. Become familiar with the TWU library and available resources.

<h3>Unit 9 Learning Activities</h3>
We are near the end of our investigation of research designs and the interpretation of research reports.  This week, in Unit 9, you will be reading about the common elements of a conclusion section of a research report in Chapter 14 of Plano-Clark and Creswell's (2015) text.  After you have read the chapter, then you will be working through the last few servant leadership articles to evaluate and interpret the conclusions section of a research report.
<h3></h3>
<h3>Learning Activity 9.1 - Evaluate and Blog Post</h3>
Before we get into the conclusion of research reports, first you will peer review one Action Research project (from Unit 8) by colleagues in the class. I have posted the peer-review partnerships in Moodle under the assignments tab.

For your review make notes about the strengths of the project idea as well as areas to work on (clarify, more analysis, more personal application) by using the evaluation criteria for an action research study outlined by Plano-Clark and Creswell on page 444-445. Here are questions you should address in your evaluation:
<ul>
 	<li>Does the project focus on a real problem in practice?</li>
 	<li>Does the researcher plan to study his or her own practices or plan to collaborate with community members?</li>
 	<li>Does the project include careful reflection about the problem?</li>
 	<li>Does the researcher plan to gather several sources of information (e.g., qualitative and quantitative procedures)?</li>
 	<li>Does the researcher develop a clear plan for addressing the problem?</li>
 	<li>Does the project include reflecting, thinking, looking, and gathering information and acting?</li>
 	<li>Will the results of the project enhance the lives of those involved?</li>
</ul>
Summarize your notes in a response to your colleagues projects in 250-350 words.

Please post your review <strong><em>on your own blog</em></strong> and include a link to your colleague's post so that they can see your review. Remember that your response will be visible to all members of the class.

<h3>The Conclusion Section of a Research Report</h3>
The final section of a research report is the conclusion section and the back matter.  Leedy and Ormrod observe, “Any research report should end by bringing closure to the interpretation of the data” (2010, p. 296).  They assert that the conclusion is where loose threads are gathered together, and in particular, the author looks backward and distills into a few succinct paragraphs what the particular research has accomplished.  All significant aspects of the research report are brought together in proper perspective, including relating the findings or results to the conclusions.  Above all, a good conclusion makes explicit how the findings or results support the conclusions.  Also, Leedy and Ormrod (2010) suggest that the conclusion should identify the weaknesses and limitations of the study, suggest practical implications of the findings or results, and make recommendations for further research (p. 297).
<h3></h3>
<h3>Comparing the Contents of Conclusion Sections of Different Research Approaches</h3>
Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) provide a helpful chart on page 472 that provides a comparison of the contents of the conclusion section for quantitative and qualitative research reports.  In common, the conclusion will report a summary of the major results or findings, a statement of comparison of the study results or findings with those of similar previous studies, a statement of the implications of the results or findings with suggestions for practice, a statement of the limitations of the study, and a concluding statement as to the overall significance of the study.  Significant differences are found in that quantitative studies explain the study results in terms of the predictions (hypotheses) discussed in the introductions, while qualitative studies "interpret their results in terms of their overall goal to explore a central phenomenon to describe its complexity and meaning" (p. 472).

<h3>Learning Activity 9.2 - Read, Evaluate and Reflect</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>In this learning activity you will begin by reading chapter 14, "Conclusions," in Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015).</li>
 	<li>Select <strong>one</strong> of the servant leadership articles listed under the unit 9 resources to focus on for the learning activity.</li>
 	<li>Using the evaluation criteria on pg. 476-477 in Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015), evaluate the quality of the discussion/conclusion section in the servant leadership article you chose. The figure on page 477 provides a template for recording your rating and rationale for your evaluation.</li>
 	<li>In your reflective learning journal, discuss the following questions:
<ul>
 	<li>Are the major results identified and summarized?</li>
 	<li>Are the results related to the literature?</li>
 	<li>Are appropriate implications of the results for practice identified and justified?</li>
 	<li>Is there a thoughtful critique of the study's limitations?</li>
 	<li>Are suitable suggestions for future research provided?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Note that these questions make up Part 1 of your Blog assignment for this unit.  See Unit 9 Assessment for more details.</li>

<h3>Elements of Back Matter</h3>
Three common elements may be found in the back matter of a research report.  You will always find a reference list—you may find additional notes and appendixes provided.

Notes can provide both general and specific information.  General information would include how to contact the author, who funded the study, or thanks and credits to individuals who contributed to the study. Sometimes the author will provide specific information in notes to the reader.  Usually this is done by adding a superscript number in the text that will refer either to a note at the bottom of the page or an endnote found in the back matter.  Either way, they serve the same purpose—they convey additional information that is useful but for whatever reason did not fit into the main body of text.

Second, you will find extensive reference lists.  The governing mantra proclaims, <em>Every source cited in the article should appear in the References. Every entry in References should be cited in the main body of text.</em>

Remember that a References list is different from a Bibliography.  A References List <i>ONLY</i>  includes those sources that are actually cited.  A Bibliography is much more extensive, and includes those sources which have influenced the author’s thinking whether specifically cited or not.

Finally, you will often encounter appendixes.  Because of the space limitations inherent in journals, appendixes in journal articles tend to be brief, and often are not provided when you really wish they were.  Appendixes often provide specific details regarding data-gathering instruments such as a survey or interview questions.

As a consumer of research, the back matter can be a valuable feature of the research report.  The reference list can be useful in identifying further research reports for you to read, or theorists to investigate. Pay close attention to theorists or particular studies that are repeatedly referred to in the back matter of a number of research reports.  As we saw earlier in this course, this is how you can make decisions as to who the primary theorists or foundational thinkers in a given discipline are.  If possible, when you have identified these foundational thinkers, read them, and only read their interpreters if you have a specific reason to do so.

<h3>Learning Activity 9.3 - Blog post</h3>
We have now concluded our investigation of research designs and the interpretation of the consequent research reports. In this learning activity, prepare a brief 250- to 300-word response to the following:

The most important thing for me about the conclusions section of a high-quality research report is . . .

Close with one question that invites further comment and discussion.

Make sure you add a link to this page in your post.

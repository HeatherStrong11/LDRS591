This week, in Unit 7, I have prepared an audio message to introduce you to mixed methods research.  You can listen to my audio message here:

<strong>Reminder: In week 8 you will need to create your own audio recording to share your action research idea with your colleagues.  Make sure you take some time to practice what you are going to say (I highly recommend creating a script) and give yourself lots of time to record, make mistakes, re-record, make more mistakes, take a break, re-record and then post it on your blog.  Have fun!</strong>
<h3>Learning Activity 7.1 - Read, Watch and Reflect</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Read chapter 12, "Mixed Methods Research Designs," in Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015).</li>
 	<li>Next, watch the following video by Dr. John W. Creswell, "<a href="http://johnwcreswell.com/videos/">What is mixed methods research?</a>" In this video Dr. Creswell explains how the use of both qualitative and quantitative research methods can provide a more complete picture.</li>
 	<li>Read the article "Applying mixed methods to leadership research: A review of current practices" by Stentz, Plano-Clark and Matkin (2012).</li>
 	<li>In your reflective learning journal, discuss the following questions:
<ul>
 	<li>What is at the heart of the quantitative/qualitative debate?</li>
 	<li>How has mixed methods been seen as a remedy for advancing leadership research?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mixed-Methods Research Designs</h3>
As you look at mixed methods designs, notice how the following considerations help to differentiate the four variations of mixed methods that Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) distinguish:
<ul>
 	<li>What is the purpose of needing qualitative and quantitative data?</li>
 	<li>What is the sequence of qualitative and quantitative data collection?</li>
 	<li>What is the priority of the qualitative and quantitative data?</li>
 	<li>How do the two data sets inform each other?</li>
</ul>
For example in a <strong>c</strong><b>onvergent parallel design, </b>only one data collection phase is used, during which quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis are conducted separately yet concurrently. <b>When to use it?</b> To develop a more complete understanding of a topic or phenomenon.

In an <strong>e</strong><b>mbedded (concurrent nested) design, </b>only one data collection phase is used, during which a predominant method (quantitative or qualitative) nests or embeds the other less priority method (qualitative or quantitative, respectively). <b>When to use it?</b> To gain broader and in-depth perspectives on a topic.

The <strong>s</strong><b>equential explanatory design </b>involves the collection and analysis of quantitative data followed by the collection and analysis of qualitative data. <b>When to use it?</b> To help explain, interpret or contextualize quantitative findings.

The <strong>sequential exploratory design </strong>involves the collection and analysis of qualitative data followed by quantitative data collection and analysis. <b>When to use it?</b> To explore a phenomenon and to expand on qualitative findings.
<h3>Learning Activity 7.2 - Read, Evaluate and Reflect</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>In this learning activity, you will select <strong>one</strong> of the servant leadership articles listed under the unit 7 resources.  Read the article and answer the following questions.</li>
 	<li>Using the criteria on pg. 405 in Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015), evaluate the use of the mixed methods approach in the servant leadership article you chose. The figure on page 406 provides a template for recording your rating and rationale for your evaluation.</li>
 	<li>In your reflective learning journal, discuss the following questions:
<ul>
 	<li>What was the purpose of the study?</li>
 	<li>Is there a rationale provided for needing a mixed methods design?</li>
 	<li>Is the choice of the mixed methods design appropriate and justified?</li>
 	<li>What were the results of the study?</li>
 	<li>Does the use of mixed methods produce a good understanding of the study's purpose?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Learning Activity 7.3 - Interview and Blog post</h3>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1535585504618_19">In pairs, you will be given the task of interviewing a partner about transformational servant leadership.  During your interview, you will ask both open-ended and closed questions. Here is a list of the open-ended questions:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>Ask your partner to complete the Servant Leadership Questionnaire found here: <a href="http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/leader/servant_leadership_survey.html">http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/leader/servant_leadership_survey.html</a></li>
 	<li>Then interview your partner and ask the following questions:
<ul>
 	<li>Describe an example of a TSL leader in your life.</li>
 	<li>What values and characteristics define that person?</li>
 	<li>What does Transformational Servant Leadership (TSL) mean to you?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Record your findings by preparing a brief 250- to 500-word blog post:</li>
</ul>
<div>Interview Guidelines:</div>
<div>- You may choose to interview your partner in-person, over the phone, over email or via skype.</div>
<div>Begin the interview with “warm-up” questions to develop rapport.</div>
<div>Ask simple, easy, short questions.</div>
<div>Let people finish.  Given them time to think.</div>
<div>Listen attentively to what is said and how it is said.</div>
<div>Clarify and extend meanings but do not impose meaning on them.</div>
<div>Do not talk too much.</div>
<div>Use active listening: “wow”, “tell me more about that”, “that is really interesting”….</div>
<div>Don’t be afraid of silence.</div>
<div>Make sure you take good notes and upload them to the forum for</div>

<h3>Unit 7 Summary</h3>
A wide vareity of mixed methods research designs have been used by researchers. It is common in mixed methods designs to see the researchers count (quantify) certain kinds of qualitative data.  As well, you will encounter quantitative researchers reporting how their research participants perceived or were emotionally impacted (i.e. qualitative data) by the experimental treatment (Leedy &amp; Ormrod, 2013, p. 97).

In general researchers conduct mixed methods studies when both quantitative and qualitative data together provide a better understanding of the research problem. The use of mixed method research provides a number of advantages, namely:
<ul>
 	<li>Provides strengths that offset the weaknesses of both quantitative and qualitative research.</li>
 	<li>Provides a more complete and comprehensive understanding of the research problem than either quantitative or qualitative approaches alone.</li>
 	<li>Provides an approach for developing better, more context specific instruments.</li>
 	<li>Helps to explain findings or how causal processes work.</li>
</ul>

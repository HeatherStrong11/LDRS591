<h2>Unit 9 Assessment</h2>
<h3>Unit 9 Blog</h3>
Blog posts are to be submitted by<strong> Friday at midnight</strong> of the week they are assigned to allow time for your colleagues to respond to your questions over the weekend. Be sure to respond to 2 or 3 of your colleagues posts.

In unit 9, you are asked to write the following blog post:

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000">[Heather, please delete questions that aren't graded.  Also, please check the word count.  We can say 500-750 total words, or split it up for the different parts]</span></strong>
<h4>Part A</h4>
Before we get into the conclusion of research reports, first you will peer review one Action Research project (from Unit 8) by colleagues in the class. I have posted the peer-review partnerships in Moodle under the assignments tab.

For your review make notes about the strengths of the project idea as well as areas to work on (clarify, more analysis, more personal application) by using the evaluation criteria for an action research study outlined by Plano-Clark and Creswell on page 444-445. Here are questions you should address in your evaluation:
<ul>
 	<li>Does the project focus on a real problem in practice?</li>
 	<li>Does the researcher plan to study his or her own practices or plan to collaborate with community members?</li>
 	<li>Does the project include careful reflection about the problem?</li>
 	<li>Does the researcher plan to gather several sources of information (e.g., qualitative and quantitative procedures)?</li>
 	<li>Does the researcher develop a clear plan for addressing the problem?</li>
 	<li>Does the project include reflecting, thinking, looking, and gathering information and acting?</li>
 	<li>Will the results of the project enhance the lives of those involved?</li>
</ul>
Summarize your notes in a response to your colleagues projects in 250-350 words.

Please post your review <strong><em>on your own blog</em></strong> and include a link to your colleague's post so that they can see your review. Remember that your response will be visible to all members of the class.

<h4>Part B</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Select <strong>one</strong> of the servant leadership articles listed under the unit 9 resources to focus on for the learning activity.</li>
 	<li>Using the evaluation criteria on pg. 476-477 in Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015), evaluate the quality of the discussion/conclusion section in the servant leadership article you chose. The figure on page 477 provides a template for recording your rating and rationale for your evaluation.</li>
 	<li>In your blog, discuss the following questions:
<ul>
 	<li>Are the major results identified and summarized?</li>
 	<li>Are the results related to the literature?</li>
 	<li>Are appropriate implications of the results for practice identified and justified?</li>
 	<li>Is there a thoughtful critique of the study's limitations?</li>
 	<li>Are suitable suggestions for future research provided?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Part C</h3>
We have now concluded our investigation of research designs and the interpretation of the consequent research reports. In this learning activity, prepare a brief 250- to 300-word response to the following:

The most important thing for me about the conclusions section of a high-quality research report is . . .

Close with one question that invites further comment and discussion.

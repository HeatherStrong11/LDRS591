<h3>Academic Integrity and Avoiding Plagiarism at TWU</h3>

As scholars pursuing higher education, academic integrity is a core value of the entire TWU community. Students are invited into this scholarly culture and required to abide by the principles of sound academic scholarship at TWU. This includes, but is not limited to, avoiding all forms of plagiarism and cheating in scholarly work.

TWU has a strict policy on plagiarism (see academic calendar). Learning what constitutes plagiarism and avoiding it is the student's responsibility.

Two resources describing plagiarism and how to avoid it have been prepared by TWU Librarian William Badke and are freely available for viewing at the URLs below:

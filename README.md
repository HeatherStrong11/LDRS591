Welcome to LDRS 591:  Scholarly Inquiry.  The course introduces you to a fundamental component of graduate work – disciplined scholarship.  Graduate education is rooted in a strong tradition of research and scholarly endeavor that includes exploration, creative conceptualization, and systematic inquiry.

This course has been developed in response to feedback from students and faculty in the MA in Leadership program who have recognized the need for further preparation around scholarly inquiry and research methods before initiating LDRS 697/698.  To meet this clearly identified need, the course provides an overview of: the research process, the activity of critical analyses, and associated skills required for scholarship and research.  It is the main prerequisite for the culminating activity of the MA in Leadership program, LDRS 697/698.

LDRS 591 is positioned in the first year of your program to strengthen your analytical and writing skills; it will benefit you in your remaining course work.  The course aims to equip you as a scholar-practitioner.

By now you are well aware of the applied nature of the MA in Leadership program.  This feature may be an important part of what attracted you to the program!  Why then study research methods?  Why worry about scholarly inquiry?  This course in research methods/scholarly inquiry helps you to develop systematic thinking skills applicable in all realms of leadership and everyday life.  As Plano-Clark & Creswell note, research adds to your professional knowledge, informs your position in policy debates, and contributes to the improvement in your practice \(2010, pp. 4-5\).  Moreover, our leadership practice is ideally evidence-based; that is, based on evidence derived from systematic scholarly inquiry.

A cautionary note:  This course is not intended as a research methods course that will develop advanced or even intermediate skills in empirical investigation in quantitative and qualitative methods.  Rather, the course provides an introductory “toolkit” that will support your work on your applied MA in Leadership activities in LDRS 697/698 and in your further professional work.  The course focuses on identifying the skills of academic writing and retrieval and critical appraisal of scholarly literature.  Its aim is to equip you to be a knowledgeable and critical consumer of scholarly literature in general and research in particular.

The course has been developed around several key ideas:  
•    As with other MA in Leadership courses, the onus for learning in this course is on you. What does this mean? Simply stated, the benefit that comes to you will be directly related to your personal level of engagement.   
•    The course builds a community of scholarship.   


A Note about Learning Resources.  

The textbook Understanding Research by Plano-Clark & Creswell serves as a primary resource for this course.  The authors explicitly state their purpose: “The goal of  this book to help you learn how to read and make sense of research reports” \(Plano-Clark & Creswell, 2015, p. 3\).  Another attractive feature of the text is its interdisciplinary approach, complementing MA in Leadership’s interdisciplinary program.

The second text for the course is the APA Manual Sixth Edition, 4th printing \(Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association\). Notice that the 4th printing is significant.  Previous printings had numerous errors that were corrected in this printing.  You will use this resource extensively as a reference in the writing and formatting of program assignments and LDRS 697/698 components.  You will find some sections more applicable to your work than others, i.e. you will need to learn thoroughly the material on citations, and references and possibly less probably to aspects such as table design.

Welcome to LDRS 591:  Scholarly Inquiry.  The course introduces you to a fundamental component of graduate work – disciplined scholarship.  Graduate education is rooted in a strong tradition of research and scholarly endeavor that includes exploration, creative conceptualization, and systematic inquiry.



A Note about Learning Resources.

The textbook Understanding Research by Plano-Clark & Creswell serves as a primary resource for this course.  The authors explicitly state their purpose: “The goal of  this book to help you learn how to read and make sense of research reports” \(Plano-Clark & Creswell, 2015, p. 3\).  Another attractive feature of the text is its interdisciplinary approach, complementing MA in Leadership’s interdisciplinary program.

The second text for the course is the APA Manual Sixth Edition, 4th printing \(Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association\). Notice that the 4th printing is significant.  Previous printings had numerous errors that were corrected in this printing.  You will use this resource extensively as a reference in the writing and formatting of program assignments and LDRS 697/698 components.  You will find some sections more applicable to your work than others, i.e. you will need to learn thoroughly the material on citations, and references and possibly less probably to aspects such as table design.

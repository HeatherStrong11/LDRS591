Goals of LDRS/MAEL 697/698

The LDRS/MAEL 697/698 is the capstone of the Master of Arts in Leadership program.  This course is the vehicle upon which your personal Leadership Competency Development will be framed and documented.  


The purpose of LDRS 697/698 is to encourage learners to integrate their learning in the Master of Arts in Leadership and the Master of Arts in Educational Leadership programs and apply the curriculum themes of:  
1\)    Transformational servant leadership  
2\)    Values based leadership  
3\)     Leadership ethics

The process of designing and completing LDRS 697/698 itself is part of the higher order learning process.  LDRS 697/698 is focused on integrating the learning from various courses into a more comprehensive understanding of leadership. Courses will be collectively analyzed and re-evaluated to determine meta-themes to inform a deeper level of scholarly inquiry in the field of leadership.  Furthermore, LDRS 697/698 will ensure that each student is focused on an individualized educational plan as he navigates through each course and learning experience.   


LDRS 697/698 consists of three credit hours of work, and represents the final demonstration of a student’s ability to integrate practical program curriculum content and demonstration of MA Lead’s defined leadership competencies: Visioning and Strategic Thinking; Adaptability and Change; Results; Team Leadership; People Development; Innovation; Values and Ethics; Service & Quality Orientation; Relationships & Collaboration; Planning & Organizing; Higher Ordered Analysis.  


You will document your implementation of the goals of LDRS 697/698 through your completion of a series of elements largely negotiated between yourself and your advisor which demonstrate your personal leadership development and value added to employers.  LDRS 697/698 requires competent use of evidence-based scholarly knowledge, ability to analyze an issue, discipline in the problem-solving process, and scholarly documentation and presentation of information.  
LDRS/MAEL 697/698 Processes- Praxis

Glanz has described an action research cycle as consisting of six steps:  selecting of a focus, followed by data collection, then data analysis and interpretation, then action based on the data analysis, followed by reflection and then either continuing with or modification of the action, all leading back to the selection of a new focus \(Glanz, 1998, p. 27\).   At that time, I suggested that the cycles of action research as described by Glanz share a great deal of conceptual overlap with the process known as “praxis.”

Praxis is a transliteration of a Greek word that is focused on both doing and planning \(Kittel, Bromiley & Freidreich 1964-1976, p. 632\).  A number of prominent educators have adapted this word to educational use.  Widely known for his emphasis on praxis, the Brazilian educator Paulo Freire conceives of praxis as action and reflection \(2006, p. 94\).  He asserts that humans are marked by the results of their actions.  In acting they transform, and in transforming they create an environment that conditions their acting.  Praxis hinges on dialogue that demands the problematic confrontation of knowledge “with the concrete reality in which it is engendered, and on which it acts, in order to better understand, explain, and transform that reality” \(Freire 2006,  p. 111\).  
There is consensus among adult educators that adults learn best by doing.  Jane Vella defines praxis as “learning by doing” with “built in reflection”, and includes it as one of her twelve keystones to effective adult learning \(1995, p. 33\).   To Vella, praxis is a kind of dance between inductive and deductive forms of learning, and involves cycles of doing, reflecting, deciding, changing, and new doing.  To the African educator Gichia, praxis is a rhythm between action and reflection, and then further action informed by the reflection \(1989, pp. 98-99\). By way of illustrating how praxis works, Ted Ward \(n.d.\) has suggested a rail fence analogy to describe the education of professionals such as you.   The elements of his analogy may be diagrammed as follows.

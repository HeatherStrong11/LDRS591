### Overview:

In unit 6 we continue our overview of the most common research methods used in leadership research.  Remember that the purpose of these overviews is that you will be a more informed consumer of research and a practitioner of evidence-based leadership practices.

Earlier when we explored the introductions to research reports we saw that the research problem establishes why a particular research study is worth doing, the review of precedent literature establishes what is already known about the problem, and the research purpose establishes what the research specifically intends to do.  In this unit we want to continue to extend this to the next major section of a research report:  The methods and results.  Because of the great differences in quantitative and qualitative methods, we have broken this discussion into two units.  In unit 5 we focused on the methods and results of quantitative research reports, while unit 6 will focus on those of qualitative research reports.

### Learning Objectives:

1. Appraise the uses of qualitative methods for leadership studies.  
2. Examine various qualitative research methods.  
3. Distinguish the processes of various qualitative methods including narrative, phenomenological, grounded theory, case study, and ethnographic research designs.  
4. Compare data collection and analysis methods for qualitative studies.  
5. Contrast the quantitative term “generalizability” with the qualitative term “applicability.”  
6. Critique the methods and results sections of a qualitative research report.
